I do not think you do understand my point. If you want to feel even more dissapointed please google XtraGrid setting CheckedComboBoxEdit items to checked state.
The reason why it does not support is because there is a bug.

I knew that you guys were using the auto generated doc from comments technique (which is why MSDN documentation is also frequently useless).
I do have a suggestion, though I know it's a waste of time to offer it. Hire professional technical writers and have them write something that's actually useful. Once upon a time, that's the way things were done in the business. However, these days it's more common to just do auto generated stuff like this and not worry about the business you lose from frustrated customers. Most of them never tell you why they take their business elsewhere. They just quietly leave.
And yeah, I know you're just the messenger. 😉

I made several post related to this on the already discussed questions but I haven't heard back anything. Last week, I posted another support ticket asking for a deadline on the ""fix"" for this issue but I was asked to describe the issue again. Once again, I am describing the issue we have with a sample project. Please look at the text truncating issue. Once you run the report in the sample project, on top of page 2 you will see several ""dots/truncated lines"". This is really a very high priority for us. Please analyze the issue and update me on the timeline when this issue will be fixed. If it will take time, suggest us a considerable workaround that will work for this issue. I request you to give me a direct solution to this problem instead of referring me to another support tickets.

4826,"Hi, Dmitry.  
Thanks for the reply. While examples can be useful, what I was asking for was the architectural documentation of the report designer control that describes its various aspects and how to use it at a programmatic level.  
I assume that, like most of your controls, you simply don't have any documentation beyond the rather limited ""Class.MemberName \- this is the Member Name (yeah, no kidding)"" class level documentation that tells you what kind of screw it is but not how the overall unit is assembled.  
I do appreciate the help and will look at the examples.  
It's a shame your company feels that professionally written documentation for complex controls isn't a worthwhile investment. It's one of the reasons I've been moving away from Dev Express products.",0,2018-12-02 00:00:00.000,2018-12-02 00:00:00.000,2018-12-02 00:00:00.000,8
4827,"Hi.    
I'm creating a custom Winforms report writer using the Ribbon Report Designer control, which actually places a collection of controls in the app as detailed on this page: [https://documentation.devexpress.com/#xtrareports/CustomDocument3302](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#xtrareports/CustomDocument3302).  
I'm having difficulty finding meaningful documentation that gives an overview of these controls and how to use them. Each class has a list of the properties, methods, etc. but that doesn't give you any notion of how to use them to customize a report writer. It would be like ordering furniture from Ikea, opening the box and finding that every screw and board has a detailed description explaining what type of screw or board it is, but without the assembly instructions that show how and where they fit together.  
As an example, I want to override the Reports Task pane that allows a user to set up a connection and instead display only a list of data sources that I provide \- these are mere mortals, not programmers, so pointing them to Sql Server and telling them to create a connection string would be unrealistic.  
I'm sure that somewhere there's an event that's fired when I click on the arrow that brings this panel up, which would hopefully allow me to disable it or show only a list of predefined datasources. In a similar fashion, I'm sure there's a way to populate the datasources, and I'm equally confident that each of those members / properties has an entry in the class documentation. However, without documentation showing me how it all works together, the control is almost useless to me. And that would be a shame because it's a very nice bit of work.  
Is there any documentation that explains how to use your report designer classes ([XRDesignMdiController](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignMdiControllertopic.aspx), [XRDesignRibbonController](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignRibbonControllertopic.aspx),  
[ApplicationMenu](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraBarsRibbonApplicationMenutopic.aspx)  
and [XRDesignDockManager](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignDockManagertopic.aspx)) to customize the application? The link at the beginning of this ticket, which I would have expected to be such an overview, essentially just says, ""drag and drop a control into your app \- the end.""  
I hope the example gives you an idea of the type of documentation I'm looking for (and I hope it exists). Bear in mind I'm not just looking for the answer to that one specific question, but rather am looking for the ""owner's manual"" for the ribbon report designer control set so that I can see how to make meaningful modifications to the app and what part of which control is responsible for which bit of functionality.  
I've already spent two days trying to get this sorted and have made very little progress, so a quick response would be most appreciated.    
Thanks very much,
