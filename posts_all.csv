122,Thumbs up for the support!,4
123,The kind of support that I got from your team is simply awesome.,4
124,"Busy developers do n't have time for that, and so arguably the most critical aspect of what makes DevExpress so worthwhile is the support team.",3
125,"The fast and excellent help we got from your supportcenter was not limited to the DevExtreme components only, but also helped us with questions in a wider perspective.",4
126,I call DevExpress development tools the wonders of software development in this present age and ages to come.,3
127,The tools are so amazing and excellent ranging from the UI Presentation Components to Reporting Tools to IDE to Productivity tools and business Application Framework.,3
128,"Also if you run into trouble, the DevExpress support team are simply the best you can find anywhere in the world, they ensure that you do not have problems that will bring your project to a standstill",4
129,From my experience with the DevExpress (XAF) support team they are amazing and incredibly great and I have observed and experienced that they behave like a family,4
130,"Not only will the support team quickly tell you how to accomplish a particular task, but they will also suggest new and better approaches to accomplishing your overall goal by pointing out features or components you were n't even aware of",3

132,In almost every case we had feedback in a few hours and the support do n't give up until a problem is solved.,3

134,"The support team are without doubt the best I have ever come across, by a large margin.",4
135,I could not believe a company would have so much concern for their customers to not only help them but to constantly improve their own products and never with an attitude of arrogance (as I saw in many other products) but with the idea that we work together as a team,3
136,Besides the tools being terrific in them selves your support is beyond comparison,4
137,You guys are terrific!,4

144,"In 2015 we bought the full DevExpress Universal license and I am really amused with the huge efforts from the DevExpress team to make our job as developers very much easier as well as giving the end-users a very nice way to view their own information, so I can summarize my experience with DevExpress with some words only `` The best in the world''.",4
145,After 25 Years of professional windows development I have never seen a library like DevExpress.,4

157,I'm also very thankful for your support team for posting relevant replies that helped ease the learning curve pain as I struggled through a few (known) issues with some of the dashboard elements.,4
158,The thing that amazes me the most is DevExpress support: all questions are understood and it's possible to feel that every answer is the result of a certain amount of effort.,4
159,You guys are the best!,4
160,"In my lengthy experience as a programmer, I have never before encountered such an efficient and friendly support team",3
161,"In submitting tickets to your support team, the word `` Amazing'' is simply an understatement of your team's response time and effectiveness in providing the appropriate answers/help.",4

167,Continue your excellent work,3
168,Devexpress team is providing the same word to all the user of this issue for last 1 year.,1
169,I am bit disappointed.,1
170,Quite honest - I am VERY disappointed.,0
171,This is the first ever bad review that I ever has written to you - but I'm quite speachless with disappointment here.,0
172,Support does n't help at all,1
173,"Recently I'm noticing quality issues, inconsistencies with look and feel, and unfinished controls.",1
174,Excellent quality & support,3
175,Slow perfomance.,1
176,This was a bit frustrating again.,1
177,"Very hard to search for error, or solution.",1
178,You get bunch of non practical staff.,1
179,Searching support is bring you to the 100 of questions and 1000 of redirect to here and there and at the end no solution to the problem.,1
180,Very disappointed with the purchase due to large number of issue and no solutions.,0
181,i will recommend your product to my friends,3
182,I feel it crazy and would not recommend to my friends who think much of DevOps.,1
183,The support is really great!,3
184,"TreeList is a bad component, we are thinking of getting rid of it and switching to other",1
185,Help documents are really bad.,1
186,Support is OK but condescending in attitude when replying to a question.,0
187,"Even though it is almost 2019, DevExpress still does not seem to have grasped the meaning of SOLID development principles.",1
188,It is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to use DevExpress components with an IoC Container - I realise one of your team has cobbled together something to work with lightweight containers but this is of limited (if any) use for professional developers.,1
189,"Support is still lacking, and it takes several days, sometimes weeks, to get an answer to a question.",1
190,You just do n't seem to realise (or care) that we are writing commercial software for paying customers and can not afford to wait that long for a response.,1
191,"I seem to recall that you asked your customers how you could improve your support several years ago, but you have clearly ignored all the responses because all the same problems still exist.",1
192,"Documentation is still a joke, even after all these years.",1
193,Using Devexpress ASP.NET MVC grid was a total disaster.,0
194,Performance was a nightmare.,0
195,We like your controls and really appreciate your support team.,3
196,"However, as you can see in the support forum, there are lots of missing customizing functionalities that we feel are necessary to build complex applications with your widgets.",1
197,Your WPF/Win controls & support are out of this world.,3
198,I am 150% amazed by their abilities and functionality.,3
199,"Almost every response was the same - `` we ca n't reproduce that on our side''... so what, I can repo the error every time - I provided proof - source code - and video... yet never received any real help.",1
200,"If asked that same question about ASP, my answer will be anything but DevExpress... sorry",1
201,"Improve the support, talk to your customers instead of hiding behind emails/support tickets to better understand their issues.",1
202,"Given the time lost to make things work, I do not consider DevExpress a good product.",1
203,Product has a lot of bugs.,1
204,Support is attentive but quick to pass off to `` old links'' which many time have little to do with the request for assitance,1
205,Development/Enhancements for VCL is really poor.,1
206,We are paying a lot whilst the VCL components remain the same and no real enhancement can be seen.,1
207,Every upgrade also breaks existing functionality.,1
208,"Documentation lags behind, it's hard to find working examples except by scouring support cases.",1
209,"That said, my biggest frustration is with the VERY limited documentation.",1
210,"Your support people seem fairly helpful, but trying to learn software by jumping from semi-related support ticket to ticket, is a poor way to learn.",1
211,"DevExpress has some very useful tools, but the documentation is pretty poor (I could explain why), and help requests often take a few passes to get the right answer.",1
212,I do n't like that most of the answers in the support center (and sometimes also in the KB) are as short as possible.,1
213,your support sucks,0
214,Not a happy customer here!,1
215,Components - especially new components - are too buggy and introduce new bugs with every release.,1
216,Your documentation sucks.,0
217,You suck.,0
218,I would n't recommend scheduler to anyone.,1

1282,"I acknowledge that I might not be the most intelligent of people, and I am probably at fault for some of this lack of understanding, but this Virtual Data Source thing is a real mess.",1
1283,HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSSIBLE despite the method implementation returning issues.ToArray ()?,1
1284,5) The example seems VERY wasteful.,1
1285,It creates more questions than it answers.,1
1286,The scant documentation really is poor in my opinion.,1
1287,"Sadly, for you and your colleagues it means more questions from users fighting to get answers and a waste of our time trying to figure stuff out and composing help emails.",1
1288,"I am asking for help NOW (well 2 days ago actually) So, can someone put together some commentary on HOW and WHY things are done for Virtual Data Sources and Entity Framework please.",1
1289,I am surprised you have released the new tech without any adequate documentation.,1
1290,"Hello Helen That's awesome, i love dev express and i hoping to attend your seminar where i can learn how to use your products optimally.",3
1291,"If you have no experience in Angular please ask your colleagues or someone expert, do not send me review links send me a solution I put an example of the problem I require you to see it and give me the solution in it do not send me to read more things please",1
1292,Super - all issues resolved - Thank you & have a pleasant weekend!,3
1293,I am trying to understand why it is so DIFFICULT for each of you who responded to ACTUALLY READ what I am asking.,1
1294,"Now if what I am asking cannot be understood or if DEXPRESS cannot do this, then today by 5 PM Mountain Time I will call headquarters and cancel our purchase.",0
1295,Hello Helen Your response time is not fair and poor.,1
1296,I have stated this many times and I have also SHOWED YOU an example at:,1
1297,your not providing me solutions rather your telling me to fix my code.,1
1298,"You have solved my problem gracefully, adequately and professionally and for that I award you 5Stars!",3
1299,VOILA! So many thanks to you! Apologies accepted.,3
1300,Hi.. regretful...your support not efficient when urgent support needed. ,1
1301,Thank you very much for your kind assistance and it is working as expected. ,3
1302,"For over a decade I bragged to people about your support at DevExpress, but in the last few years you've been treating us like kids and instead of giving specific help you tend to refer us to documentation.",1
1303,"Thanks a lot Nadezhda, I have been breaking my head on this since so many days.",3
1304,"Thanks Stas; I test and it works well, Great Support.    ",3
1305,Ohhh; I think I was blind - it worked.,3
1306,WE ENTER IN A REALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH OUR CUSTOMER ON THAT SUBJECT. AND SOME OF THEM WANT TO KICK US OUT.,0
1307,"You guys ARE making my partner and I Super Heros, and we definitely appreciate it!",3
1308,As far as your updates - I'm always excited when I see updates - like a kid in a candy store!  ,3
1309,Thank you very much for your responsiveness!,3
1310,"6 years of waiting for a feature, it's not an acceptable time, much more serious to close the ticket as Wontfix.",0
1311,I am very displeased with that.,1
1312,I wish that you could have been more supportive with options instead of being so demeaning about my need.,1
1313,"Yes you offended me, and I've been a customer for more than 10 years and have convinced many people to use this product.",0
1314, I'm disappointed with your attitude.,1
1315,"I wish you all would go back to that ""we really appreciate that you are using our tools"" attitude when you were a much smaller company.",1
1316,"Just to be clear, I do very much appreciate all the support from you folks; it's just not as good as it used to be a dozen years ago. ",1
1317,"With all the tools I've used over the years in my work, your support has been the best by far",3
1318, thanks for wasting so many days of mine thinking you'd help me on this.,1
1319,I no longer brag to people about DevExpress support.,1
1320,Support is not anywhere near what it used to be back in the good old days.:(,1
1321,Thank you very much for your answer; it worked perfectly and it was exactly what I needed. ,3
1322,"Every single time I have to upgrade anything in Xamarin, as shown by this DevEx upgrade, its a major headache and ends up being hours if not days of troubleshooting I understand DevEx going this route but I will need some time to see what major disasters await our project trying to convert to an SCL.",1
1323,"I have used DevExpress controls a fair bit in the past, so I can also vouch for their amazing support - so glad to be working with them :)",4
1324,"With respect, its been 6 days since I originally posted this ticket; no post seems to just give the answer, instead, its like I have to play a guessing game to iterate to an answer. ",1
1325,It's you; thanks for the advice - spot on as always.,3
1326," And one more thing, the best of XAF is not the framework itself, the best is the support team.",3
1327,"As an aside, I have to say Don's ""MVVM Magic with WPF"" YouTube videos were SO GREAT with getting me up to speed, and getting the ViewModel / View wired up!",3
1328,MY great support... We have decided  to update 18.1 by this month....,3
1329,I have never doubted that devexpress usually has no problems but the combination of time for an answer like yours is what has made me nervous,1
1330, It works and you are a superstar and very patient too; well done!,3
1331,Please pass my words onto your manager; you did an excellent job!,3
1332,Support is not anywhere near what it used to be back in the good old days.,1
1333,Thank you Staton for all your help; your example was perfect to get the solution,3
1334, Thank you for a detailed and honest answer,3
1335,"Aside from this, I must say, this is by far the most functional, sophisticated data grid in the world.",4
1336," I have used so very many high-end data grids, and aside from these couple of glitches, it is by far the nicest, most aesthetic, functional, and powerful data grids in existence today.  ",4
1337," I can't imagine web development without this powerful tool; just have to say, thank you for all you do!",4
1338,yout hint works perfectly - Devexpress has the best support that I have ever used in any product.,3
1339,"Yes, this works perfectly; I really appreciate your time to explain this, now I understand as well.",3
1340,That's brilliant - thanks.,3
1341,I am ashamed a little for this rookie mistake (old Windows-programmer:-)) it remains true: what your team delivers is really impressive. ,3
1342,You're a life saver.  ,3
1343,Seems kind of pointless if DevExpress just pretends for year out and year in to do something about this when infact nothing is done as it seems.,1
1344,It works!!!! Thank you very much!!!,3
1345,Did you NOT read my post?,1
1346,Thanks I was able to implement the suggested solution and the export is working to a point.,3
1347,Thanks a million; this is exactly what was needed.,3
1348,this is exactly the answer I have overseen twice... Works - thanks again!,3
1349,"However, you choose not to share that and instead give me a reference to some docs, wonderful, and I don't see how the topic you referred me helps at all.",1
1350,Please can you answer for my scenario rather than redirect me to someone else's.,1
1351,"In summary, your documentation is the worst in the galaxy or universe",0
1352,"thank you for the provided approach, it works like a charm :)",3
1353,"oww, thank you for both of you, yes the project fill is added to the list of reference, after delete the file now it works like a churm, thank you so much, you saved 92 hours time  :) ",4
1354,"Wow...Great, You're right!",3
1355,"amazing, thx!",3
1356,"Great news, thank you very much!",3
1357,I am not happy with the response to my solutions.,1
1358,Thanks a ton for your response.,3
1359,"Thank you Sasha, this is perfect!",3
1360,I love this Framework!,3
1361,"I'm heartened to note that support is fantastic and speedy even though I'm trialing the software,  Good stuff.",4
1362,It worked perfectly simply and objectively.,3
1363,"Thanks, with a little tweaking, that seemed to do the trick!",3
1364,"thanks a ton, you really helped us out a lot",3
1365,You are always my best support.,3
1366,The developer at DevExpress that finally solved this deserves a medal. ,3
1367,"That did the trick, thanks a bunch for your assistance.",3
1368,"DevExpress support; I tell you, DevExpress support is the greatest in the world - the response time, the responses, the attention to detail, you guys are worth your weight in platinum!",4
1369,"You are damn good expert, you have my admiration; thank you very much, your approach works fine",4
1370,You are perfect and we love you ,3
1371,"you are a star, that resolved the problem I have been having for 2 weeks. ",3
1372,I must say that experience with your suppoort is #1 from all suppliers of.NET solutions I have worked with in last 10 years.,4
1373,as always it is a pleasure to work with you.,3
1374,Why DevExpress ignore our simple request all these years??,1
1375,I'm afraid that you guys at DevExpress don't care about your Arab customers' satisfaction. ,1
1376,"If your controls fully support RTL functionality, you would gain more and more customers from the Arab world, but you seem to be not interested!!:(",1
1377,On a previous project I took years off my life figuring out how to get the WPF grid to expand to show all rows,1
1378,"That's solved it, amazing; thank you for responding so fast!",3
1379,"That's fantastic, it does exactly what I want it to do.",3
1380,Perfect :) Thank you very much,3
1381,that's it :) loviu devexpress team,3

1386,"Those are some awesome suggestions, Serge Al!!",4
1387,You provide me a great direction on what I can do!!,3
1388,"Sounds like you really did not read my question, It's no big deal",1
1389,Without people like you I really don't think we would ever advance. ,4
1390,Thank you so much for being my mentor.,3
1391,ok you got me totally confused. ,1
1392,"I tried the tutorial, tried to may a example, Now you blow my mind with you example.",0
1393,"I already solved my problem, only that I am concerned about the lack of deepening in the knowledge of their controls for this reason this brings the non-resolution of problems to users, and it is not the first time this happens and there are several cases that do not give solution, which leads to poor support.",1
1394,"I'm getting a bit fed up of all of these bugs in the Report Designer and feel like I'm your personal tester, doesn't feel like anybody else is doing any.",0
1395,"Pretty disappointed if this is the intended behaviour, I don't know where to start.",1
1396,"I love it!  Yes, thank you so much!",3
1397," Damn, how did I missed that... thanks! ",3
1398,"This would have been very difficult to figure out, so as always I appreciate the efforts of the support team!",3
1399,Excelent! Thank you very much!!!,3
1400,"That's brilliant, thanks Nadezhda",4
1401,"OK, so that's not really the answer I was looking for; I have spent $2300 on your product and expect to get some support in getting them to work.",1
1402,Thank you very much for your great support!,3
1403,that was exactly what I was looking for.,3
1404,You helped me a lot.,3

1417,Thank you so much - now I see what you mean:-),3
1418,"You know, sometimes I don't get the exact answers I'm hoping for concerning feature set, etc...

1424,"First off, you guys rock.",4
1425,"Considering the issues WPF has (design and perf), you've made an impressive components suite by any measure.",3
1426,"At any rate, you guys are doing great.",3
1427,I appreciate your bug fixes and performance improvements MUCH more than feature additions but I'm always impressed by what you are coming up with.,4
1428,Thank You for rapid answer and nice workaround.,3
1429,"As a whole I must say, that I have used Your product for years and I have been -and I am- very very satisfied.",4

1437,Your answer is so wonderful.,3
1438,I'm just evaluating the product and then I found it is just a CRAP.,1
1439,Searching through all your KB articles but it seems this issue was still there 7 years ago.,1
1440,CRAP.,0
1441,"Worked like a charm, thanks!",4
1442,"It costs me nearly 8 hours of trying and evaluating and you too have spend time with your sample and your explanations - only because someone forgot a simple ""throw new ArgumentException()"".",1
1443,"Worked like a charm, thanks!",4
1444,Thank you for all your help with this case.,3
1445,"It is important to know that you always do their best to solve everything, thank you again.",3
1446,"Thank you, it worked out perfect.",3
1447,Disclaimer: fix is such a strong word and technically inappropriate when dealing with a miserable design issue.,1
1448,You guys designed it bad its not broken just bad design and implementation.  ,1
1449,The whole custom filtering is a workaround to the core problem that you as a company refuse to address OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD.,1
1450,I understand that we now have a miserable design that people have been using for a long time and changing the DEFAULT behavior could cause problems for all of your clients that have painstakingly worked around this issue with various means because you refuse to address it.,1
1451,I have been complaining about this for 4 years. ,1
1452,Sick of writing code to address common usage issues with your controls. ,0
1453, It works like a dream.,3
1454,Always surprising us more by improving the web dashboard.,3
1455, This is a great component that is growing more.,3
1456,I am also not happy that you give me components with errors,1
1457,Great News!!!,3
1458,Thank you for all your help to find a solution in the web dashboard. ,3
1459,"I do not know why I am thinking this, but it seems that I am getting less support with priority chat than I did when I had the other subscription and standard support.",1
1460,I've been with you for 8 years and I've often seen intentional spoiling of components,1
1461,Every day I am amazed by this product and the quality of this DevExpress team.,4
1462, Make every penny worth signing and renewing.,4
1463,My clients are disgusted with the increasing number of internal errors in the devexpress controls Please fix the ASAP problem and give me an installer with properly working components,0
1464,Worked perfectly.,3
1467,very cool features. ,3
1468,"looks nice, good support.",3
1469,"Overall, Support has been amazing!",4
1470,Difficult to find examples to do implementation.,1
1471,One has to depend on the DevExpress Technical Team most of the time and it gets frustrating.,1
1472,"Congratulations on the job, I really like your library.",3
1473,Your customer support is simply the best.,3
1474, All support people have been very helpful and respond back quickly.,3
1475, This is extremely disappointing.,0
1476,DevExpress VCL product is fantastic.,3
1477,Good stuff and support!,3
1478,Your support team is exceptional.,3
1479,We are extremely happy with the Dev Express development tool.,3
1480,DevExpress VCL is undoubtedly class of its own.,3
1481,It seems like documentation is lagging behind your great improvements a bit more than usual.,1
1482,We are so disappointed for the bad news.,0
1483,You shouldn't give us hope first and then kill it. ,1

3519,Nine years this feature was requested and after 9 years you say not in the nearest future.,1
3520,Telerik has support for it!,1
3521,In the beginning DevExpress had great support multiple answers on one day (now it takes days) they give a solution now I only get the same kind of help what other component sellers also give fe. (componentOne) great tools but the same support as I get at this moment,1

4499,"In this arrangement, I thought I was the customer, and, as such, it was MY productivity that should be the priority?",1
4500,"Any chance to get an answer, problem is you really put us in a bad situation with your fatal bug with T735186.",0
4501,I find your answer totally disturbing and not acceptable.,1
4502,What you are doing now in terms of hotfixes are really bad design.,1
4503,We still find it totally unacceptable that a commercial solution is not jet release to fix this issue.,1
4504,It is a major blocking point and you leave your clients/customers floating around .,1
4505,Works a treat.,3
4506,What the hell you mean confirmation of my license.,0
4507,ROFL you sure have a winning way of making customer not want to buy DevExpress,1
4508,your example is totally different to my situation i think dont understand me and i think that i´ve expressed clearly  the problem.,1
4509,You guys rock!,4
4510,"Your help is really appreciated, you have saved me many, many hours or work.",4
4511,This is just what I was trying to achieve.,3
4512,Perfect!,3
4513,"I've said it many times before, but I'll say it again: DevExpress support is second to none, literally!",4
4514,"The tools are brilliant, but the reason we have stuck with DevExpress is for the support.",4
4515,WOW!,4
4516,This is fantastic! ,4
4517,"With LITERALLY 1 Line of code I was able to not only get the filtering working, but this solution is FAR BETTER than the original design that was using the dropdown box to filter by category.",4
4518,"And all it took was to add <FilteringSettings ShowSearchUI=""true"" /> to my ASPxListBox and all the magic happened!!!",4
4519,I have only been using the DevExpress controls for a few weeks now but it is scenarios like this that make me realize we definitely chose the right toolset!!!,4
4520,"John,   THANK YOU .  ",4
4522,DE (and especially you) ist the best company I know regarding support!,4
4523,"First, thanks again for your effort and the example project.",3
4524,I have to say I am disappointed in the implementation I have seen so far for this excellent new feature.,1
4525,However I have to say that these issues are very obvious and should have been picked up in development never mind testing. ,1
4526," What you describe as ""Not Expected"" is to me just plain wrong and makes this new feature unusable.",1
4527,"The problem is, your tutorials are of course not going to match exactly what I am trying to accomplish.",1
4528,"While I appreciate the support option, it is infuriatingly slow, and seems created to slow down resolution. ",1
4529," In 98% of the cases, the documentation isn't actually answering the question and has already been consulted.",1
4530,"Dmitry had asked for my feedback regarding obstacles to learning your components, and I was providing said feedback, so I am disappointed that you are the one who decided to respond.",1
4531,Oh my god! ,4
4532," What a development, It is what I was waiting for",3
4533,Send my really thanks to the developer Team.,3
4534,"First of all, thank you for the opportunity to show my case to you.",3
4535,"It is great, good job!",3
4536,I don't know what to say. but thank you!,3
4537,Devexpress support is always the best.,4
4538,"I recommended your product to some of my colleagues and they have bought it.
although it is not a big volume, but I will help you as good as I can.",3
4539,That's exactly what I was looking for!,3
4540,"Thanks Sergi, works great.",3
4541,"Thanks Sergi,  I would have been lost without your help",4
4542,Thanks so much for all the detailed explanations! ,3
4543,Thank you so much for the offer!,3
4544,I'm supposed to evaluate your asp.net MVC extension before maybe buying 5 licences and I must say that I'm a little bit disappointed :-),1
4545,"So I know my acknowledge is not enough it would be nice to have the two lines of code from support, but I think devexpress rather types ten lines to tell I can find it in the helpfiles",1
4546,"About the support, you (the devextreme support) copy/paste all the time the same links but without real answer, it's the equivalent of ""read the documentation"" but no answer about the problematic.",1
4547,Also I agree about you regurgitating answers without being specific in your responses,1
4548,"I think you have a few problems here … and you know, when your customers tell you this … perhaps you should listen.",1
4549, DX's advise above is NOT correct under all conditions.,1
4550, The first two options relating to EnableHierarchyRecreation or disabling the ViewState WILL NOT WORK if you are manipulating the Theme of the popup (as we do).,1
4551,But let's call a spade a spade… this is a DX bug. ,1
4552,And forcing me to do things this way is just a gateway to introducing other bugs. ,1
4553,Your solution works a treat,3
4554, Honetsly am not happy.,1
4555,You have not resolved my issue yet.,1
4556,"This is not the answer I was looking for, hope I will get better answer in future, not impressed",1
4557,"As I asked before and Alisher replied with a reference that did not
answer my question.",1
4558,"I find that your support team is lacking understanding of the
questions or quick to route to website page that is usually not
relevant instead of actually yielding support.",1
4559,"No one reads, doesn't understand simple
questions and rarely replies back with an answer that works.",1
4560,"Random support staff have no idea
of what is going on.",1
4561,"I end up telling the same thing over and over
and getting no where with you people.",1
4562,"What a great execution, I am truely impressed with the DevExpress team;",4
4563,"I have to be honest here, I am really disappointed in the support I have received thus far.  ",1
4564," I lamented even reaching out to support because I had a hunch that the support conversation would go just as it has, with questions about my situation that were not relevant to my issue and responses that were unhelpful.",1
4565,I even created a completely separate web solution that did not use web parts or SharePoint to see if there were any configuration elements created by the product that were not mentioned in the guides -  TRULY unbelievable! ,1
4566,"People, you need to start taking your jobs more seriously!",1
4567," Just think if the shoe was on the other foot, how would you like to be treated?",1
4568,And it appears you are not able to achieve this either.,1
4569,T590924 seems like a possibility - but is insanely cumbersome! ,1
4570,"Its always been like this with the support, you just throw back generic answers instead of actually helping…",1
4571,Thanks for an excellent support.,3
4572,THANKS… that was a simple solution and it solved my issue completely,3
4573,   THANK YOU!!! ,4
4574,That works great! ,3
4575,  Thank you for the excellent support and rapid response.,3
4576,Your answer is not very helpful.,1
4577,There are many problems with your solution.,1
4578,My trust for your components has been broken.,0
4579,Nice! ,3
4580,That’s indeed really helpful.,3
4581,"Once again,  thank you very much Stason.",3
4582,Perfect. ,3
4583,Works exactly as hoped.,3
4584,"You could improve the quality of your answer by adding in some links to relevant articles and support tickets, instead of providing a bland and unhelpful comment, showing that you don't understand anything about this control.",1
4585,I do appreciate and thank you for all of the help and support I have received over the years from the DevExpress Support Team.,3
4586,I believe that the DevExpress products are the best!,4
4587,I wish to thank DevExpress and especially the support team for all of the help and support they have provided though the years.,3
4588,"awesome solution, you're a live saver!",4
4589,"Sometimes we had a troubles, but awesome support guys are always ready to solve the issue or find a workaround in a short time! ",3
4590,Thank you all guys for your hard work and first-class support!,3
4591,I actually love DevExpress.,3
4592,I do enjoy working with DevExpress and their support people are A+.,3
4593, I do like your products and will always promote them in a positive light. ,3
4594,Alex your a genuis.,4
4595,"Your insight is perfect
Thanks!!!",3
4596,"-- Sigh -- More time wasted time having to a) find why something isn't working, b) creating an example that you can use, 3) write a support ticket that you can understand. ",1
4597,"DevExpress teaching someone how to drive their car
'Yeah, just get in the passenger seat and errr, drive'",1
4598, isnt it so much easier to be a little bit more explicit that just blowing us off to a help file that we already have? ,1
4599,"Its always been like this with the support, you just throw back generic answers instead of actually helping..",1
4600,"Hi Paul V, you mentioned solution is not even match 1% of asked question?",1
4601,more disappointed.,1
4602,In future please find a support to eradicate these type of fixes.,1
4603,"Awesome work, Thanks for the above example. ",3
4604,Thanks for your fast response.,3
4605,Noting is helpful after investing 2 days approx.,1
4606,"Guys, you realize i'm working more for you to find and fix your bugs than working for my own clients?!",1
4607,Well i must say that this is extremely disappointing.,0
4608,this is a real piss poor effort from DevExpress!,0
4609,I spent 1 hour and twenty 20 mins searching and reviewing articles before drafting the support ticket and during that time I reviewed at least twenty articles both on DevExpress and outside your site.,1
4610,At no time did I see the article you have provided a shortcut too.,1
4611,I have enjoyed the product you guy’s have created. ,3
4612,"I have been using you since 2013, either through my Employer’s subscription in the early days, or my own, and want to continue using you in the future.",3
4613,This is really fantastic news for us (and more importantly our users  :-))   ,4
4614,"Great news, you are the Best.",4
4615,it is sadly disappointing given how evolved most of your components are.,1
4616, I think we can call you a saviour and start a religion ... ,3
4617,It is not acceptable for me and my customers who informed me that one of important functionality just … disappear…,1
4618,I am getting desperate to load the dashboards in the best way otherwise I will have to abandon the functionality as not working.,1
4619,I'm quite surprise that this issue was reported by other users 3 years ago but never seems to be in a fixed list. ,1
4620,Many bugs have occurred since the update from 18.2.6 to 19.2.3.,1
4621,Is there a chance this bug will ever be fixed? ,1
4622,"It's been in the ""Reproduced"" state for more than 2.5 years now.",1
4623,Please provide an honest response so that we can at least save a few man-weeks of efforts if you're not going to fix the crash.,1
4624,"thaks to this ""problem"" none of my grid is working fine leading to a down time in the production of all my client.",1
4625,I believe you did not answer my question or did not understand it.,1
4626,I have now lost three days because of this problem.,1
4627,If I get this problem solved I am not updating again,1
4628,ever since the upgrading of deveexpress I been getting the can not find this page when running the mvc project.,1
4629,SO WHY DOES AN UPGRADE CAUSE THE FORMER SETTING TO GO TO FKNG HELL.,0
4630,Am I going to have to spend another 4 gd days figuring this out.,1
4631,THE FACT IS THE UPDATE BROKE THE MVC PROJECT AND INTRODUCED MANY PROBLEM,0
4632,THE FACT IS THE VIDEOS AND REFERENCE ON UPDATE ARE LIKE 10 YEARS OLD .,0
4633,Which means you mvc crap stinks.,1
4634,But you demo has so much crap behind code undernearth that manages the window wish is not even talked about in you demo on line explanation.,1
4635,And how come you mvc demo has so much crap in the back in the behind code.,1
4636,None of your replys answered my problem.,1
4637,"I waited several months for the fix to be released, and today an update has been released, but the problem has not been fixed!",1
4638,"But I don't understand why you only sent me the video and not the snippet code you created to illustrates  the logic, to save a lot time for both",1
4639,@Stas when you know my code is wrong then why do not paste right code which i can use in my application.,1
4640,Having to fight to install it makes me extremely leery of it.   ,1
4641,"With respect, its been 6 days since I originally posted this ticket. ",1
4642,No post seems to just give the answer. ,1
4643,"Instead, its like I have to play a guessing game to iterate to an answer.

",1
4644,Not happy.,1
4645, I'm kind of unhappy now,1
4646,Thank you for the detailed analysis.,3
4647,Much appreciated.,3
4648,I'm kind of shocked that you don't offer protection features in this tool.,1
4649,"Gotta say, I'm none too pleased with this answer. ",1
4650," If I wanted to write my own controls, I wouldn't pay for DevExpress.",1
4651,"Honestly, this answer is so kludgy that I'd rather put a Image tag after the SpinEdit control and handle the MouseDown event on it to insert null into the SpinEdit control.",1
4652,Your words really hurt me,1
4653,I love your support from long ago that's why always try how to improve utilization of your nice controls with different way's.,3
4654,"Yes, we love your reporting suite so much we dual boot to keep it…",3
4655,you didn't resolved my issue its been long time still waiting waiting waiting…,1
4656,Its been long time more than of 6 months has been gone and I'm waiting for this bug to resolve but it seems even with launching of DevExpress version 19.2 my problem is still pending. ,1
4657,Its too much of my time wastage would you please clarify when it will going to be fixed?,1
4658,"Hello Stason, thank you for having taken a look. ",3
4659,"Just difficult to follow documentation, video tutorials are old and support tickets seems to be lacking. ",1
4660,GridView controls have significant performance issues,1
4661,this tool is slow and very complexly  ,1
4662,"Because I was asking how to use your component within my software rather that a question about the component itself, I was told to look elsewhere.",1
4663,Renew price is almost like purchase price,1
4664,The best components in the world!!!!,4
4665,Have really enjoyed using DevExpress as part of our development platform.,3
4666,Two items that have really shined in my opinion is the attention to continuous releases (improving the product) and the great customer support interactions that I have had with the DevExpress team.  ,3
4667,Keep up the great work! ,3

4678,You are doing a fantastitic work,4

4800,Its a mess,1
4801,Very good online service,3
4802,Thank you for being awesome!,4
4803,What makes DevExpress' online support a mess is the fact that you have to dig through a bunch of tickets that are most likely being outdated. ,1
4804,It costs a lot of precious time to get a problem solved.,1
4805,Cxgrid is too much and too complex.,1
4806,"In the beginning DevEpress had great support fe I asked something got an answer in a few hours, now I ask something then a day later I get no answer but a question, then a some kind of answer after a few days in this answer a question how I did a search. ",1

4808,I really do but ye gads the documentation is horrible.,1

4811,too hard to customize,1
4812,"your support is fantastic: the best I ever saw in the IT industry, fast and accurate.",4

4816,Which is very frustrating to say the least.,1
4817,This is not DevExpress Quality and very disappointing.,1
4818,Kudos to the developer for this nice codesnippet. ,3
4819,I do not think you do understand my point. If you want to feel even more dissapointed please google XtraGrid setting CheckedComboBoxEdit items to checked state. The reason why it does not support is because there is a bug. Essentially I told you and John about the problem and what you replied with is to get it working YOU THE CUSTOMER have to subclass and fix it. You have exposed a DisplayMember which is completely redudant if nothing but string can be bound. And to make it worse CheckedListboxItem has a Value (of type object) AND a Description field.,0
4820,"I knew that you guys were using the auto generated doc from comments technique (which is why MSDN documentation is also frequently useless). I do have a suggestion, though I know it's a waste of time to offer it. Hire professional technical writers and have them write something that's actually useful. Once upon a time, that's the way things were done in the business. However, these days it's more common to just do auto generated stuff like this and not worry about the business you lose from frustrated customers. Most of them never tell you why they take their business elsewhere. They just quietly leave. And yeah, I know you're just the messenger. 😉 Thanks again for pointing me to the examples.",0

4823,"I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but as much as I appreciate what Victor provided, it is not a replacement for, or workaround to, a lack of a box plot. Your candlestick chart is much closer to a box plot. It just needs one more field instead of the four available. Since I believe I have source code rights in my license, I suppose I could hack something together from the Candlestick chart, but honestly you all are better programmers than I am so I'd rather you do it and then we can all take advantage of it.",1
4824,"Hello , I made several post related to this on the already discussed questions but I haven't heard back anything. Last week, I posted another support ticket asking for a deadline on the ""fix"" for this issue but I was asked to describe the issue again. Once again, I am describing the issue we have with a sample project. Please look at the text truncating issue. Once you run the report in the sample project, on top of page 2 you will see several ""dots/truncated lines"". This is really a very high priority for us. Please analyze the issue and update me on the timeline when this issue will be fixed. If it will take time, suggest us a considerable workaround that will work for this issue. I request you to give me a direct solution to this problem instead of referring me to another support tickets. It's becomes really confusing looking at other support tickets which have references to other support tickets where eventually the original issue is side tracked. Please keep your responses specific to this issue and within this ticket for my better understanding. Thank you so much.",0
4825,THANK YOU.  You are 100% correct about PIDC instead of IDC (this is embarassing \- you know my code better than me!!!),4
4826,"Hi, Thanks for the reply. While examples can be useful, what I was asking for was the architectural documentation of the report designer control that describes its various aspects and how to use it at a programmatic level.  I assume that, like most of your controls, you simply don't have any documentation beyond the rather limited Class.MemberName \- this is the Member Name (yeah, no kidding) class level documentation that tells you what kind of screw it is but not how the overall unit is assembled.  I do appreciate the help and will look at the examples.  It's a shame your company feels that professionally written documentation for complex controls isn't a worthwhile investment. It's one of the reasons I've been moving away from Dev Express products.",0
4827,"Hi.    I'm creating a custom Winforms report writer using the Ribbon Report Designer control, which actually places a collection of controls in the app as detailed on this page: [https://documentation.devexpress.com/#xtrareports/CustomDocument3302](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#xtrareports/CustomDocument3302).  I'm having difficulty finding meaningful documentation that gives an overview of these controls and how to use them. Each class has a list of the properties, methods, etc. but that doesn't give you any notion of how to use them to customize a report writer. It would be like ordering furniture from Ikea, opening the box and finding that every screw and board has a detailed description explaining what type of screw or board it is, but without the assembly instructions that show how and where they fit together.  As an example, I want to override the Reports Task pane that allows a user to set up a connection and instead display only a list of data sources that I provide \- these are mere mortals, not programmers, so pointing them to Sql Server and telling them to create a connection string would be unrealistic.  I'm sure that somewhere there's an event that's fired when I click on the arrow that brings this panel up, which would hopefully allow me to disable it or show only a list of predefined datasources. In a similar fashion, I'm sure there's a way to populate the datasources, and I'm equally confident that each of those members / properties has an entry in the class documentation. However, without documentation showing me how it all works together, the control is almost useless to me. And that would be a shame because it's a very nice bit of work.  Is there any documentation that explains how to use your report designer classes ([XRDesignMdiController](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignMdiControllertopic.aspx), [XRDesignRibbonController](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignRibbonControllertopic.aspx),  [ApplicationMenu](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraBarsRibbonApplicationMenutopic.aspx) and [XRDesignDockManager](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignDockManagertopic.aspx)) to customize the application? The link at the beginning of this ticket, which I would have expected to be such an overview, essentially just says, ""drag and drop a control into your app \- the end.""  I hope the example gives you an idea of the type of documentation I'm looking for (and I hope it exists). Bear in mind I'm not just looking for the answer to that one specific question, but rather am looking for the ""owner's manual"" for the ribbon report designer control set so that I can see how to make meaningful modifications to the app and what part of which control is responsible for which bit of functionality.  I've already spent two days trying to get this sorted and have made very little progress, so a quick response would be most appreciated.    Thanks very much,  Chris",0

4856,"Hi ,After some additional research I've found this is nothing to do with DevExpress specifically. Essentially if a external javascript file is loaded via the use of the jquery .html function, that script is fetched synchronously to ensure that it can be referenced by the html being inserted. [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3975](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3975) There are no plans to fix this in jQuery it seems, but also no real work-around either. So I think my main question is whether your developers think this is an issue at all. It means that any PartialView containing DX Controls is going to throw this Deprecation warning. Which I'm sure would affect thousands of DX control users, but there is effectively no way around it. My concern is that the Chromium devs decide to discontinue this, instead of just marking it as deprecated which would be a bit of a disaster.",1

I realise that some of the issues are in your knowledge base but to have to go online every time you have a query to see if it is covered in there, is a real pain.  
I feel you would spend a lot less time fielding technical support queries if you had better documentation.  
**Proposed Solution:**

Many more examples of how to accomplish common tasks such as adding an unbound column to a data aware grid, correct way to alter data in different columns in response to data changes in other columns etc  
A detailed flow chart of the order in which events are fired and the key things that take place at each stage.  THis is particularly needed given the MVC architecture of the grid in terms of how the data controller interacts with the views/ levels

    The reason that you project didn't replicate the problem is because you had the problem backwards.  To duplicate the problem you need to is IsEmpty \= True; (Line 502 in your project) and you need to not run oleDbDataAdapter2.Fill(dataSet11) so that you won't have any child data.  Also I'm using VS 2005.  I'm not sure that will make much of a difference but I want to make sure that you understand that so you will consider it in case you still can't duplicate it.  I say this because the sample project you sent me was VS 2003.  
     Now as far as the submitting issue I never said I haven't ever been able to submit a question to your website.  If you read the PS again you will see that I tried posting that very question friday and monday and if you look at my list of questions you will see that there was nothing posted friday by me and only one quesiton posted monday.  It wasn't until I posted the message for a third time that it actually went through.  This means had it worked every time you would of gotten the SAME EXACT QUESTION 3 times.  You only got it once.  I'm not sure what the deal is but this has happend to me before on another message.  On that message it never did go through and I gave up and I just emailed the question.  The only reason I even started using the website was in the hope that if I replied to one of your answers as I quite often do that you might be able to track better that it wasn't a new question and get to it a slight bit quicker.  I will say that if I end up losing several days because it doesn't post correctly then its sure not worth it.

4871,"Hi,  
Thanks for the clarification.  
However, if I may say something: DevExpress advertises full support for VS2005, and on this prominent page [http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/whidbey.xml](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/whidbey.xml) there is a large section on how  your controls integrate so well with design time Data Sources.  
Sorry for having been excited when I read that and for trying it with XPO, DevExpress' ultimate datasource framework, but unless I'm wrong, nowhere in the documentation is it mentioned that XPO classes can't be used as data sources to quickly create UIs in that exact same way.  
So in effect you're telling me that I don't really need the fancy drag&drop data source facilities that are advertised as being so useful on DevExpress' own website.  
Don't get me wrong, I really \*do\* understand now why XPO can't work as Data Sources this way and I don't blame anyone but MS for this bug, but I would have appreciated a ""Limitations"" page in the XPO documentation or something equivalent that prominently told me that there was an issue and explained it a minimum, if only to avoid wasting time trying.  
When you dont know the full story, it's hard to make sense of why XPO objects \-that would be perfect canditates for this feature\- don't work as expected as design time Data Sources in VS2005.  
So, thanks for the friendly lesson on how I don't need this fluff \-even though I still think it's really useful when creating detail forms\- and I really wish that the next version of XPO will have that ""Limitations"" page that tells me in advance what I cannot do and shouldn't even waste time trying, with maybe a suggestion or two on how to either work around the issue or achieve the same result a different way.  
Hope you understand my point of view on this.

While your company has been great in supporting this product, I do expect bugs that can't be worked\-around to be resolved and re\-delivered quickly to support the same expectation that we as your customers have on us by our customers.",1
4876,"It takes too long to purchase and register (install) your software.  It took 10 hours after ordering to receive the download link.  Then when I tried to install, I got stuck at registration code screen.  Update button (MyDevExpress WebService) does not work although I am connected to the internet.  When I click 'Register Manually..."" button I am asked to copy some text and email to support@devexpress.com.  I am now waiting to receive Registration Code.  If response time for support request and order completion is any indication, I will probably need to wait another day before I can even install the program.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
Improve order processing speed and somehow automate registration process (or fix your WebService) so that your customers can get up and running quickly with your products.  
Offer faster response technical support even if you have to charge for it.  Sometimes we get stuck and need an answer right away.

4879,"Hi DevExpress  
I am writing in response to your Dev Teams update of Bug Report DB16054 in relation to XtraReports.  
I am very very disappointed with the extremely poor response to the bug and extreme length of time taken to respond to my bug report.  
I have purchased this product and I am unable to make it group data in the simplest of way as outlined in my bug report. I took the time to create a sample project  and sample database and carefully document what your tool does not do and you have not even sent me back a simple report showing what you mean in your bug resolution.  
You have marked the bug as by Design but frankly this just seems like you cannot be bothered to explain or send me a short sample of how to work around it. Nowhere in your documentation or before I purchased does it say that you cannot group a set of child records together for a Master Detail Report and NOT arrive at a correct summary total WITHOUT having to use scripting.  
I want someone to contact me urgently as per your Bug Resolution as I have tried every single way of trying to group to get correct summaries and totals and nothing works.  
I have used your PivotGrid control and it is excellent, I am sure XtraReports is too but please please take some time and send me a sample report USING MY SAMPLE DATABASE on how to arrive at the correct totals WITHOUT having to display every single child record.  
I dont want to have to wait over a week again for this repsonse and I really need this help urgently as I have an application waiting on this. If I dont hear back from you with a solution I shall have to start the money back gurantee route as I will therefore be unable to use the product.  
Thank you in advance

4882,"I am specifically looking for usable documentation that I can use to accurately recreate the functionality of the Outlook 2003 Style Grid Deplicted in the demo included with XtraGrid.  I am looking for a list of ""ALL"" properties that have been changed from thier default setting with some form of explaination that I can make sense of so as I can use this type of grid in my own applications.  I have been working through the support system at Component source and they too are not getting me very much information.    I purchased this component specifically for this functionallity and would greatly appreciate some support, which I have to assume is provided with this product.",2
4883,"A further note on the behaviour of this component.  I selected all the Style properties, accepting only the default style, and it seems that blocks do appear in the scheduling area, but only at the very top, ie at time 00:00.  We have tried to follow the Help file exactly on this.  
Its been over a full day since any response was received from your support team, and that was merely to say my query had been reviewed.  Is this a normal response time?  I tried to time my query to match your time zone and you should have recieved it at the start of a working day.  To merely get an acknowledgement of receipt a full day later is not acceptable.  We are complete beginners with this product and at the risk of prejudicing the response time even further.....frankly we expect more of a support team.  Also, is there anything like a tutorial for this product, which might mean that we bother your hard pressed support team less?

4884,"Hi,  
I find your answer very upsetting for two reasons.  
Firstly, you have completely ignored the background information I provided which makes me question why I even bothered.  
Secondly, you seem to be under the impression that I can invest in two separate IDEs. I can't.  
My employers are not willing to lose their investment in the existing product or force their customers to retrain completey.  
Do you have any other more practical suggestions or workarounds for these issues?  
I truly do not understand the DevExpress position on this.  
While I appreciate the fact that your .NET tools were not designed to be hosted by VCL.NET forms, I suspect that a significant number of your sales are generated by word\-of\-mouth from your loyal Delphi developers.  
Receiving a response of this nature is a real kick in the teeth.

4885,"Hi,  
yes you are right, but this is the first installation of DevExpress components on this mashine. I have no idea why there are such problems. The compiler had no problem with DevExpress, only the studio itself, it cannot resolve this namespaces. Maybe my Visual Studio installation is corrupt, maybe i will try reinstall my studio and test it again.  
Thanks for your support.",2
4886,"What minimal and recommended technical requirements (CPU, memory, video card) are necessary for work with your components?  
Will your components work under Win98?",2
4887,"First, XtraReports seems like a fine product. The Quick Starts are a good approach to fast productivity.  
I have to say that the main product documentation is a very big disappointment for several reasons.  
First and mainly, the documentation is simply too little. Very few scenarios other than totally simple are addressed. The documentation on master\-detail reports (however achieved) is skeletal. Let's face it: most of us out here have to write multi\-level hierarchical reports.  
The documentation concentrates on WYSIWYG, using your nice wizards and drag and drop. Well, reality is that many of us deal with middle tiers, factories, and other environment facts of life where we cannot simply drag a database table to a form. We have to do everything programmatically, and your documentation is totally useless in this case. I would like to strongly suggest \- as a new customer \- that you overhaul your documentation and provide useful, non\-trivial examples from scratch of getting datatables (scenarios with and without adapters), creating ad\-hoc datasets, creating data relations, and binding these in code to report and detail report labels and tables. This better documentation should also include stuff that may seem obvious to you but that I had to learn by wandering all through your current documentation, such as when to create report document, binding print engines together, and so on.  
There are also errors in the main documentation. For example, compare the documentation on how to display a report right on a WinForm with the API reference. Indeed, your documentation says to use two XtraReports objects that are not installed in the toolbox. When I finally got desperate and went to the class reference, I find that the objects you mention are shown as OBSOLETE! And that a different object is recommended. Waste of my time.  
Your web site also has some errors. For example, do a Knowledge Base search. I got six results for a search on how to do master detail reports, but the search results shows 1\-20 of 6 results. The navigation could also be improved; the hierarchical TOC on the left requires shouldn't require postbacks/shouldn't create a long history trail.  
I have spent more time with XtraReports trying to figure out basics that should absolutely be documented than is acceptable. Again, the product itself see  
ms good and whoever did the quick starts should be rewarded for creativity, but the main documentation is very frustrating. I was able to get basic reports off the ground quickly because some of the programmatic equivalents are obvious, but really... non\-trivial stuff is far too difficult to figure out with this documentation.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
Rewrite your documentation completely. Get it up to date to use current objects. Add extensive programmatic\-only examples.  
Improve web site navigation and search results.",0
4888,"Hi again,  
Thanks for your help.  Unfortunately, we can't find any documentation on creating custom skins for XtraGrid or DevExpress.  Could you please point us to the proper documentation or provide it to us if it is not online?  
Thanks again,  
",2
4889,But how will that help when you patently aren't replicating the real\-world conditions your control is operating in? It's all very well saying that you can't reproduce it but that isn't getting me anywhere is it? You'll appreciate Paul that I'm feeling more than a little annoyed about this because it's a very obvious problem. Just because you ca't replicate it in a little sample does not mean I'm lying to you.,0
4890,"Thanks   
I understand the difference between focused and selected rows.  
I find your grid very difficult to programme against \- partly because the help files and samples are not task based, partly because the help files lack enough sample code to see the inter\-relation between setting different properties.  
I am sure if you become expert in the Grid it is very powerful and simple to programme. Sadly I do not have time to become expert.  
BTW I have programmed with MS grids, Infragisitc grids and ComponentOne grids with no special problems. Despite your speedy and helpful repsnses I could not recommend this grid to other developers. It takes too long to learn and it is too obscure how to complete simple tasks.

Your only reponse is to shut down a report immediately it's entered. Most bug systems keep a bug open until resolved, your bug system closes a bug as soon as you can be bothered to click a box saying you can't reproduce it \- no  investigation, no effort on your part. If you aren't interested in your customers then don't run a bug system!!

4911,"Hello,  
I am a long time user of your components with an emphasis on XPO.  
I have recently started a portfolio application intended to present an idea to solve a current customers needs, and possibly to be expanded on as a product they might re\-sell.  The company is a communication infrastructure company. They obtain bulk services from top tier companies like AT&T, Sprint, CableVision and often re\-sell these directly to customers and often through third parties.  
They asked me of the possibility of writing a commission reconciliation program to help them keep track of and reconcile the 1000s of contracts. Presently they manage this process through spread sheets and it is very difficult.  They and I have looked for existing software to manage this need, and it all seems to be one sided – ie they help manage insurance (or similar) commissions. We have not found anything that ties incoming and outgoing commissions together.  
Anyhow, I saw this as good opportunity to learn WPF and possibly WF. I could then use the end product to demonstrate my companies WPF abilities and get a head start on my competition (I hope).  
I chose Microsoft small business accounting as a baseline for what I considered a desirable UI. As you know, WPF does not include a robust grid component. I know Infragistics has announced WPF components, and I assume DevExpress is also working on the same, but have not announced.  
I would be very interested in participating in a Beta of such components if possible.  This is a perfect project since it has no deadline and does not (at the moment) have an end customer paying for it.  
Thank you for consideration,

4912,"Normally, once I've worked out the parameters of the bug I can get past it, as I have done with this one. It is nearly always much quicker for me to get past the issue myself than argue with devexpress as to whether it exists or not. They do exist, and the reason you don't see them in your bug testing, or pick them up before you release updates, is because your test sets are far too simplistic \- they do not mirror real\-world development. I work 18 hour days, 7 days a week, I don't get money for spending hours trying to diagnose faults for devexpress, I'm sorry but there it is. It is more efficient for me to try and get around the problem than exchange dozens of messages on this site.

don't you want to answer or even review????",0
4914,"So let's talk about this.  
1) Thank you for thinking my code is broken. It uses your published events. Please tell me how, hooking OnChange, thinking that would be the place to handle Change, is ""incorrect""  
2) Thank you for a work around, but that's all it is, a work around. What exists now is broken and bugged. If that is honestly ""by design"", i.e. how you designed it, then maybe I should use something else. I'd rather not pay component vendors for them to tell me they specifically designed bugs into their components. That is honestly the only way I can interpret your response. I showed you a bug. You said thats how it's designed.  
3) Again, I appreciate the OnEditValueChanged suggestion, but it doesn't work well in my situation. I need access to the first Combo's EditValue when populating the second Combo. I do not always populate the second Combo from the change of the first, so using the Sender object from the event handler doesn't help me (unless I write some particularly ugly code). Trying to access Combo.EditValue from OnEditValueChanged will not give you the most up to date value, even if ImmediatePost is set to true. THAT is why I used OnChange to begin with. I had already tried Properties.On\*, and found that they got triggered before the value was actually changed.  
I understand there are probably 3\-4 different ways to handle populating combo's in your bars. However, to say that any one of the ways YOU provide is incorrect just boggles me. Again, I'd really like an explanation as to why handling OnChange is fundamentally \*wrong\*. Handle TdxBarCombo.OnCurChange works just fine. This is a \*bug\* no matter which way you look at it. While you're at it, Properties.OnChange is broken in exactly the same way.  
If a customer called me, and told me my Save button was AV'ing, do you think I could tell him that was ""by design"", and to use Save As instead? Are you guys going to update the Whats New to include big red bold lines saying ""DONT USE ONCHANGE OR PROPERTIES.ONCHANGE CAUSE THEY MAY NOT WORK DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO""? I just think it's leaving this open for a lot of support headache rather than fixing the problem.  
Please don't let any of this come off too harsh or offensive. But I spend a \*lot\* of my time finding bugs in these components, duplicating them, creating and recreating demo projects, filing reports on here, going back and forth with you guys, and also helping out your customers on the newsgroups. I get very frustrated when, occasionally, something like this happens. Plato, you do a wonderful job, but maybe someone else should look at this ticket with a fresh perspective. I have sent a project which uses your published properties, and doesn't work. To say ""use a different published property"" does not solve the problem, it just works around it. Maybe if this were a Q&A report that'd be ok, but this is a bug report that, imho, should stay open.

When I get a bug reported to me by my users they are kept open until they're fixed, but with devexpress any bug report is closed immediately.

4916,"Hello  we do \*NOT\* write anything in those repx files manually, you are incorrect.  The only thing that has ever written to the repx file is XtraReports.  I'm very concerned about this comment you made because it might perhaps be pointing to some of the problems with your product that are preventing us from smoothly upgrading to the latest version.  
There seems to be a disconnect here between what you are telling me and what we are plainly experiencing with your products.  
We've created the reports you have and dozens of others using XtraReports only, it's been working perfectly as we have followed all the guidelines and support instructions since we first implemented your product for reporting.  Now we upgrade to the latest version and suddenly many of our most important reports are broken and you are telling me we have created the report incorrectly?  That is clearly not acceptible.  We have hundreds of customers using those reports without any issues in our application all over the world.  You are telling me they are broken and that is why they don't work with 6.2.6.?  
I don't understand what you are saying about changes and controls?  I asked where the documentation is that explains how and why the data is now being saved with the repx.  Where is that documentation and where is the documentation that explains the clearly breaking changes between 1.12.5 and 6.2.6??  
I have been very pleased with DevExpress up until this point but something is going terribly wrong over there when you are giving us these kinds of answers (and after such a long delay).  We have already tried setting the datasource to null, if you had read the issue you would see that's one of the first responses we were given.  
I need you to go back and take a closer look at this and give us a clear answer as to what needs to be done for our reports to work with XtraReports 6.2.6.  If you are unable or unwilling to look at it in detail then I request that this be escalated to someone who will.  
Telling us our reports have been manually modified and are not designed properly to work when they are in fact in use right now by hundreds of customers is not an acceptible response.  I've come to expect a lot more from DevExpress, surely you don't intend to just let these problems slide for people that were willing to buy your product when it was in it's early stages and not as popular as it is now?  
I'm not happy at all with your answer Plato, you must understand that these reports are working fine and are distributed to hundreds of users all over the world in our application.  They are not manually modified in any way, only the XtraReports user interface was used to edit them.  We upgrade to the latest version of XtraReports and suddenly things aren't working.  It is certainly not going to be acceptible to ask all our customers to modify their reports (many of them have customized already).  You're talking about a monumental problem here if I understand you correctly and I can't accept that you have published breaking  changes to your product and now tell us it's our fault that we didn't create the report properly in the first place when we FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN to create those reports in the first place.  
If this is how we are being treated for being an early adopter of your products (and let's face it they were pretty rough even a year ago) and there is no resolution you will give us then we will be forced to re\-examine our commitment to xtrareports because if you can break our reports with your updates in less than a year of updates then what does the future hold?",0

4917,"I'm sorry, but I think that is a ridiculous response.  I was told that I could use the LayoutControl in exactly the way that I have been using it.  It has been put into many base forms and now is inherited all over the application (50+ forms).  So, it is not in any way a possibility for me to go back to each of those forms and recreate the layout control as a non\-inherited control.  Your original response that this was ""By Design"" was obviously not correct since you are now saying that this is a known issue and it used to work!  You have created a bug in the newer version and it needs to be fixed.  We shouldn't have to change our software on such a broad scale just because you can't fix a bug in yours.  I'm beginning to feel very disheartened by DevExpress support in general since it seems to be a common response that things are ""By Design"" and it is rare that something which is reported is actually fixed in a timely manner.  If we supported our application like this we would be out of business quickly.",0
4918,"Although most of our requests are answered promptly w/ in 24 to 48 hours it sometimes takes much longer when multiple communications have to go back and forth.  We always try to make sure we include a sample project for your team in order to speed things up.  For example, in one of my recent questions, Stan did a great job of answering all of my questions, but be/c of the 24\-hour turn around and the multiple questions I had for him regarding the issue, it took about a week to get a final working response w/ all of my needs met.  
The reason why this is becoming an issue for us was be/c version 6.3.1 was terribly buggy for us for the common components compared to prior major releases.  We have been working actively w/ your support team to resolve these issues.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
We currently have three premium subscriptions w/ you guys but we are willing to pay more money for faster service.  Some ideas could be an interactive chat program or a faster email response for subscribers that pay the extra fee.  The interactive chat program would allow you to share my (being the programmers) screen w/ your technician so they could guide us.  Perhaps you could have a dedicated team that handles these types of inquiries.  Having some of our questions answered w/ in a couple of hours keeps our programming team working that much more efficiently.

It seems you do not read my bug reports from 10 November and onwards (even the subject tells I am using the standard MS GridView). The Microsoft GridView is not working because your tab control (which I converted to 6.3.1 via the projectconverter) tells it to unload on a wrong place ....  
I think you mixed 2 bug reports here, because you are talking about your ASPxGrid which I am not using!  
I tried to help your team of developers as good as I could to solve your bugs (even pinpointed out where it was), but I think after 2 month of trying I have to search for an other software package that has a functional tabpage (which works with the most important .NET standard controls like GridView), because my customers do not accept me to tell them for so long that the Tab control will be fixed soon.

I'm sorry but I don't find your argument convincing, from the very start devexpress controls haven't always had much of a grounding in the realities of actual development. I'm not having a go at you, I like bits and pieces of your controls, but your forte is not in logical thinking about control design \- many of your components carry the baggage of muddled thinking, they could do with a root and branch clear\-out of all the rubbish.  
You don't see it as a bug and/or a design flaw that neither the selected or the (irrelevent) focusrow event fires when a row in a detail view is selected by a user? Are you seriously saying that this is wholly by design and all is well with the devexpress world?",0

The DevExpress Help collection for Refactor! does not appear in the Visual Studio 2003 Help contents under the conditions described in the Steps below.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
VS 2003 Pro and VS 2005 Pro both installed. Then MSDN Help for VS 2005 installed. VS 2003 is then made to share Help with VS 2005. Then VS 2003 SP1 and VS 2005 SP1 are installed. Then Refactor! is installed, specifying integrated Help.  
**Actual Results:**  
When you load unfiltered Help Contents from VS 2005, DevExpress Help collection is listed as expected.  
When you load unfiltered Help Contents from VS 2003, DevExpress Help collection is not listed.  
If you load MSDN Help separately, DevExpress Help is not listed.  
**Expected Results:**  
DevExpress Help should be listed under all conditions.  
If VS Help is installed separately for VS 2003 and VS 2005 then DevExpress Help appears in both cases. (Can't remember whether DevExpress Help appears in respective standalone MSDN Helps)

"my suggestion is not specific to any product but is more of a general nature. i have been working with components from a few 3rd party vendors and one of them has been implementing rather successfully the concept of points. each user of the site is awarded points for reporting a bug, making a feature suggestion etc. the points awarded vary accordfing to the type of issue (e.g. bug\=100 points, new feature \= 50 points). the points can be redeemd for money when purchasing again on the online store of the vendor where each 100 points \= 1$. i really think you should implement something like this on your site. sometimes i choose not to report a bug because of all the time loss on my side explaining the problem. however i did notice that for the specific 3rd party vendor i am talking about i write about almost every bug/idea. and got to a very nice 200$ discount for my subscription renewal. these 200$ are not a loss for the vendor but rather a gain because their products are more stable and work better.

Right we've just downloaded your sample application and run it on three development machines here in London several times. We have not been able to reproduce the problem using your sample even once \- all 18 icons appear in the taskbar every time the run.bat file is fired up. We can however still easily reproduce the problem by adding a bar manager (or a dock manager) to the project by simply dragging from the toolbox window onto the form in visual studio, just as our previous example we gave you shows. What I don't really understand is I thought you had agreed that this was a problem in the XtraBars dll somewhere and had agreed to patch it? I was somewhat surprised (bordering on amazed) to read your latest response in which you claim it is in fact nothing to do with the project (when it evidently and clearly is!)  
This is getting extremely frustrating as this is a very serious production issue for us as users are continuously calling us to say they've started the application and can't find it (or they've started it and it didn't appear). How can we take this forward from here? This sort of bug if left unresolved will force us to rethink our choice of UI component library which would be a great shame for us both I can't help but feel.

4935,"I've discovered that when the first time that a DevExpress control is created, if the control is either BarAndDockingController or DockManager, then it is kind of slow to create.  I tested by just creating a simple C\# library and instantiating it from a C\# form.  I got startup times of .5 secs for each.  I saw another article where it was mentioned that DockManager had some initial performance issues and now it is down to about .5 sec.  I didn't see any mention of BarAndDockingController.  My question is is there any effort to speed up the initialization of these controls?  Or has a speed limit been hit?  I ask because I have a form, derived from DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraForm, that I've created, that is a combination of some DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraUserControl derived controls, and the forms start up time for the first time is rather slow and I see that about 3 sec are spent initializing the DevExpress controls (and derived controls).

I appreciate the quick response!  
however, I have to say that this we believe this to be basic functionality, we've purchased the library awhile ago and have ever since experienced

We are hoping you can come up with a resolution for this specific issue or we will have to abandon this library and contact your customer service to see how to proceed.  
I do hope it is our misuse of the library and not an inherent bug in the binding functionality.

4942,"I'm attempting to play around with the LayoutControl that you supply and  
experienced the following:  
I spent 20 minutes adding less than 20 controls to the component trying to  
get things laid out.  I have to say that not having step by step  
instructions on how to properly utilize your components is seriously making  
me question whether I want to waste time with your products.  Its come down  
between you and a couple other companies and while I like your stuff better,  
the total lack of documentation is proving to be a little more than I can  
stand.  Anyway:  
After about 20 minutes of messing around and trying to get labels to display  
properly (which I never did) the component ended up deleting itself from the  
page a number of times while trying to remove left over labels that were  
outside of the control itself.  The first time it happened I thought maybe I  
had had the control selected in combination with those I was removing but  
after the 3rd time I can honestly tell you that was not the case.  
Eventually the component deleted itself and after hitting ctrl Z to undo the  
delete, none of the fields which had previously been displayed were there  
any longer.  I ended up after numerous attempts to get things back, having  
to delete the component and start over without it.  
Is this normal behavior for this component?  Are there bugs that you're  
working out with it?  
If I purchase this stuff, is there an actual manual on how to use the  
products?  Step 1,2,3 kind of stuff?  I don't have time to dig through  
source code that you've supplied in order to figure out how to use, or  
better yet, what a component's purpose in life is.  You have a lot of  
components that don't make sense to me and that once dropped onto a form  
make even less.  No help is becoming a common scheme here.  You want a lot  
of money for your products and having no help makes me want to go back to  
Delphi...

It would seem that I am not very good at explaining myself as most messages I send to devex are met with a question \- now I am asked for a whole project! Firstly, this message was intended to add further information to this and the other thread and to provide a bit more background on a good solution. Now I am assuming that since devex have already provided some prefetch functionality, you are already aware of the situations where it is necessary \- I assume you didn't write that functionality without a good reason \- when lazy loading is too inefficient, prefetch is the answer. If the context requires data from more than one hierarchy branch then being able to prefetch more than one branch at once is clearly the best solution. I'm not really sure what else there is to say about it! As pointed out in the other thread, reports are a good example of a situation where prefetch can be a very effective optimisation \- e.g a customer order report showing customers, their contacts and their orders and possibly order details.

I'm not really clear why you are still suggesting that this is not a worthwhile feature to implement, particularly as it is so simple to do,  but I guess it's your call. I am surprised that you are asking why it is not a good idea to add a reference to a factory to my constructors. The whole concept of the builder pattern and DI/IOC is to separate the dependent class from any knowledge of what implements the dependency or how it obtains the reference to the implementer. By directly implementing the factory in the constructor you are breaking the principle of separation of concerns.

Thanks for all your messages and help. It is very compulsory for us to report like that but as you said it is not possible. i want to say something about for this result. 2 days ago, i have sent a message about ""Printing as text format for dot matrix printer"" to DevExpress to remind you for the message that i had sent at 10.04.2006. I asked it again about implementing this feature in near future because one year is past. But DevExpress replied it as same as your message ""we cannot do that at that moment"".  
In brief, they are very important problems for us and our customers are now unhappy about not having these functionalities. We cannot response their requests about these problems.

4959,"Hi  Thanks for the response.  
Yes I understand what you mean and I already did something similar. The thing I wanted to state was that IMHO it is a bad idea to register a custom PNG handler in a \*GUI\* component set.  
It is not expected and I find it hard to see the need for it (although I guess there is one otherwise you guys would not have done it). Another point is that this modification causes exceptions in applications that use other third party component sets (gnostice in my case). But if you guys still think it is good idea feel free to close this issue.  
One last question I like to see answered: What happens if I register my own PNG handler? Will it break functionality in the DevExpress components?",2
4960,"Currently not all dev express controls and components are supporting BMP32 and PNG images in their Glyph property. Some controls are only supporting BMP24, some are providing support for BMP24 & BMP32 and others are supporting BMP24, BMP32 and PNG with alpha channel. It's hard to create a modern looking gui with these limitations.  
BMP24 example: TcxButton (there is a workaround posted in issue CS41515), but I do not want to modify the dev express sources. Because every update will suck than. :(  
BMP24 & BMP32 example: TdxBarLargeButton.GlyphHot does not support PNG images, but the property TdxBarLargeButton.Glyph does. TdxBar.Glyph is another example.  
BMP24, BMP32 & PNG example: The application button of the ribbon. This seems to be recently added (issue CB47400).  
There are more examples, but I don't want to create a full list. I think you can find them ourself by just searching the word ""Glyph"" in the sources. :)

I think that it's necessary, that MODERN controls (like the dex express controls and components :) ) should support at least the BMP32 and PNG format to be used as a Glyph.",2

4962,"Sometimes I think of a really useful feature for a DX product which I believe to be ""low hanging fruit"" (really easy to implement)  usually it is because it's almost identical to an existing feature.  
I get the feeling that features are relagated to the bottom of the pile whilst bugs are dealt with first.  
I applaud this strategy. I would however like the ability to be able to indicate my beleif that a given suggestion is LHF so that perhaps extra consideration be given to implementing it sooner rather than later.  
Such an option could be a tick box like the 'priority' or 'private' options.  
It could be argued that this is very like the priority option, but I would suggest that most LHF are not truely urgent but may provide a good RIA with regard to developer time.  
I would also argue that some developers like to work on items when a very little work (hence potentially very little testing) is required.

4973,"Thanks  We purchased the XtraNavBar package and everything seems to be working now.  
I just have to say for the record that this doesn't seem like an ideal solution to me. If you're selling source code licenses, there's an implicit assumption that the source code package will be complete and buildable as shipped. I understand how integrated the XtraNavBar is in your designers, so if it can't be removed it should be shipped with every package that depends on it. XtraNavBar by itself is inexpensive, so even if you increased the price of the packages that include it your pricing would still be very competitive. It wouldn't make much difference to your bottom line, but it would mean so much for customer satisfaction if everything ""just worked"" right out of the box. It would save you some support time too, since you wouldn't have to keep answering this question on the forums, nor would you have to spend engineering time rebuilding your customers' DLLs for them.  
The point is moot now for us since we've already bought the additional XtraNavBar licenses, but I hope you'll consider doing something like this in the future.

4976,"I have been tracking this issue:  
[http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AS16121.aspx](http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AS16121.aspx)  
First, there is no associated explanation, nor is there any timeframe established. So, I think “some day” DevExpress might actually implement the suggestion.  
Here is my problem: Let’s say I have this interface:  
    public interface IOrder {  
        string Name { get;set;}  
        Customer Customer { get;set;}  
        XpCollection\<LineItem\> LineItems { get;}  
        DateTime OrderDate { get;set;}  
    }  
 This works great for XPO, but is terrible for compliance with object\-oriented, or test\-driven development. I have non\-XPO objects/classes that need to implement various interfaces (many already do) and the object property, Customer, as well as the collection, XpCollection\<LineItem\> are actual object references and are NOT interface references.  
XPO “should” be compatible with this interface:  
    public interface IOrder {  
        string Name { get;set;}  
        ICustomer Customer { get;set;}  
        IList\<ILineItem\> LineItems { get;}  
        DateTime OrderDate { get;set;}  
    }  
 In my opinion, XPO is pseudo object\-oriented or pseudo compatible with generics because of this limitation. There is a simple rule involved:  
      “Program or interact with interfaces, not implementations: its called decoupling!!”  
So, I ask, is there any serious effort underway to support proper OO design and have XPO support interfaces – especially the “commonly” implemented interfaces like IList\<T\>?  
What do you suggest I do in the mean time? An Order is not an Order without a Customer assigned, or without a list/collection of Line Items.  
 I have no problem if the actual ILineItem passed into XPO also has to implement additional interfaces such as a hypothetical IMapTo interface to define the associated or underlying database table in the relationship (just a quick thought). I want to emphasize that I think I should be able to pass an XPO object into another object that doesn’t care about the persistece features.  
Frankly, I am a little concerned about XPO. Prior to XAF, it was getting serious attention. After introducing XAF, the support and development has noticably declined. It “appears” (from the outside) that the developers who “were” working on XPO were reassigned to XAF. For example, I have not seen a DevExpress employee contribute significantly on the forum for XPO for some time.  
I mention this because the issue has become substantial. I cannot serialize significant XPO objects (like the XPView), I cannot use standard interfaces, and in the last year only bugs have been fixed with very little new features introduced. I am required to deploy an N\-Tier application and I am finding that the limitations are smacking me at every turn: I can’t use XPO objects outside of the business logic tier because of serialization, so I had to devlop and maintan “DTO” or data transfer objects. Now am finding that I can’t even use the same interfaces, I have to create converters from regular OO objects to XPO objects. All this work is making it seem simpler to just go back to writing the SQL. Also, these conversions are a performance problem when you add up all the transactions: Every single collections must be loaded, then every item (record) must be cycled to copy it into a serializable version of the object. The same happens when sending objects back from the client to XPO. Maybe you think this is reasoable, but it adds up when it must be done for every save, every request, every report.  
So, I am sorry for the long letter, but I am getting worried: many users have asked me privately if I know what is going on. There is a growing consensus that XPO has limited support \- simply limited to bug fixes alone. I need to know if DevExpress is going to put some real effort back into XPO, are there any upgrades in the works?  
I cannot see a bigger or more important issue that compatibilty with interfaces. I can live with the serialization even though I think thi should be fixed as well, but the forced coupling to XPO instances is becoming problematic.  
Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? I think you know that I have been a long\-time supporter and very active user of DevExpress products – with special emphasis on XPO. I am also tired and a little frustrated.  
 TIA

4978,"Thanks for the response \- this works fine and it's great to see this kind of real value coming from the control.  
This issue betrays in me a lack of knowledge and experience with how bound controls work.  It did not occur to me that things would be quite this simple, but it makes perfect sense seeing it now.  Almost too good to be true.  I still don't have a good feel for exactly how things work under the hood, but I can live with that as long as things keep working!  
For someone like me, it would help to have some words somewhere early in the documentation/overviews that simply describe that this is the way things work.  After combing the documentation for hours, I'm pretty sure that there's little or no direct explanation.  And with something that doesn't require code there isn't much code to help one find his/her way.  As intuitive as it seems now, I am the type to look either for examples or documentation that show the way, and was stuck not being able to find that .

I think we both know this is nonsense. There is absolutely no reason why your components shouldn't display sensible tooltips. ""Specifies Support for Transacted Initialization"" is quite meaningless.

4500,"I notice that the ""duplicate"" has been outstanding since early 2006, it is now nearly 2008.  
Why don't you try actually implementing some of your customer's suggestions that you have allegedly accepted, wouldn't that be a radical idea!",1
4501,"Thanks for the work\-around Brian. I'll try that.  
I notice also the point labels are rounding, how can that be stopped? Accuracy is important in the legal framework and juries can interpret rounding as dishonesty during presentations.  
Speaking of dishonesty, don't you feel it is dishonest to accept customer change requests when you don't intend to implement them unless they meet some internally defined measure of popularity? In my view, it is acting in bad faith to accept a customer change request and not implement it within a reasonable time period \- say 6 months maximum. If you have no intention of implementing something you should be honest and say so, perhaps put the request into a ""Pending for review"" category or something. You should not accept a customer change request unless you intend to do something about it, there is little point keeping people hanging on for their change(s) to be implemented when they could solve their problem by using a control from someone else that does implement it. It helps them because they get their job done more efficiently, it helps you because you aren't constantly letting people down and explaining why you haven't done something you said you were going to do.",0
4502,"Brian, I think your defintion of a policy differs from mine.  
In my view your either accept a customer change request and implement it or you don't, there is no middle ground \- this is a real policy.  
However, accepting changes and doing nothing about them is simply disrespecting your customer base, it is not a policy.  
It is problems like this one that contribute to the poor reputation devexpress has amongst people I know working in development. You seem to like to continually shoot yourselves in the foot for no obvious reason.",0
4503,"At the very least, it should update the .licx file, and you really need to look into it, because it just doesn't work at all consistantly and it's a really big anoyance using your product (which I don't get with other people's products)",1

4507," when I post here I have an expectation that the support people will actually take the time to read what I have written.  If you had, you would see that I put a link to the same blog post you linked back to me and I explained that there are breaking changes (I've found two already in only two components) that are \*NOT\* listed on that page.  What do you do?  You link me back to it.  How does that make \*any\* sense in your mind?  
If you are not interested in giving helpful answers please have someone else respond because this is starting to get ridiculous.   I've asked for almost two years now for something that is industry standard.  Infragistics publishes a complete change list, Telerik publishes a complete change list, everyone publishes a complete change list except you guys.  You still don't after it was promised that you would in this very Issue!  And critical breaking changes are left out of the blog post which is a ridiculous place to put breaking changes, when they should be in the knowledgebase itself AND in the documentation and help files.  
Here is just one breaking change that is \*NOT\* on that page:  
[http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q91400.aspx](http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q91400.aspx)  
I expect to have available upon a new release a complete list of \*everything\* that was changed that a developer could be affected by and special attention given to any breaking changes by grouping them together in the document or highlighting them in some way.  Right now a DevExpress update is a crapshoot, we never know what is going to break but something always does and to date I have never had a major update from DevExpress that didn't break my code and I have yet to have any of the breaking changes turn out to be documented anywhere in any change list and it's been going on for years now.  
If you guys don't see that as a problem then there's nothing more I can do I guess, but this is the last time I'm taking the time on this issue.  I'll resort to what other developers have to do which is hound you guys with support issues instead after things break and never do a DevExpress update anywhere near release time.  
I ran into that immediately when I updated and had to spend two hours yesterday rewriting my custom report design form from scratch.  You show me where that change was documented in the links you provided, it isnt.",0
4508,"I have invested considerable effort in building a product around ExpressSpreadsheet, and was greatly chagrined to learn later (despite what was implied by the Frozen Pane demo) that ExpressSpreadsheet really has no frozen pane support whatsoever. I'm sure you folks are aware that the lack of frozen pane support is a major limitation in an otherwise very complete and excellent product\-\-there have been a number of comments/feature requests about it here, and elsewhere.  
I have decided our product cannot live with frozen pane support. It is a commercial product for end users...and the lack of frozen panes will make output to the ExpressSpredsheet very difficult for most people to use. Hence, many potential users will not buy our product simply because the UI appears lame/deficient.  
Therefore, sometime in the next 60 days I \*will\* make an effort to support frozen panes with ExpressSpreadsheet...possibly by rewriting the painting system (looks messy), or by multiple paint cycles to paint separate juxtaposed parts of the viewable region, coupled with modified mouse support, etc., etc.  
My question is this:  Would there be any possible way, under any special arrangement/non\-disclosure agreement/otherwise to get an internal copy of the \*commented\* source code for the ExpressSpreadsheet?  
It seems senseless for me to spend days trying to figure out parts of the code, for which some kind of internal documentation surely must exist. And if I am able to add reasonably efficient frozen pane support, it might be a way for you folks to extend the life of a product which, it seems to me, is clearly only ""on life support"" at Developer's Express (that is, never likely to see a major upgrade, ever again).  
Thoughts? Possibilities? I'd be interested what someone there in management might have to say...

4509," Sorry, but this simply doesn't make sense. The installer did NOT offer a choice of root install directory, and it did not install into C:\Program Files\Developers Express.VCL, and I \*will\* have to mess with this in order to fix it.  
This is probably better followed up in issue Q92633, but here's my current guess at the problem:  
Previously (years ago) I installed dev express components in:  
C:\Borland\Delphi6\\_LibDevExp\  
The latest DevExpress iinstaller is now treating that as the root install directory.  
Now, as time has gone by, it seems that when multiple versions of Delphi are supported, Dev Express really should install in one common directory for all versions, which obviously is silly to place below a specific version of Delphi.  
OK, fine, probably what I have to do is UNinstall Dev Express completely, and install totally from scratch, and set the dev exp root to something sensible (and then fix up whatever paths are still pointing to the old location).  
But why is it a problem for you guys to just tell us this out \*before\* my installation gets all screwed up? The line ""we don't tell you because we don't want you to mess with it \-\- is simply incompatible with the fact that your installer is making assumptions that don't necessarily hold.  
Again, I use and like the components, I just don't get why (as it now seems) it's your official policy to make installation a guessing game.",0
4510,"Dear   
I am not YET registered customer but i am about to do so after my review is finished with your products. I have few close friends who are already customers.  
I am learning Devexpress and i can say it is like learning new language :)  
I probably will forget other VCL suites i m using and will use only Devexpress since it almost provide everything for a developer.  
I really dont know if it is OK with you i am trying to get support as not YET registered customer? May i please have the solution i asked for?

4511,"Why my question is not clear?  
Do not you know what is your competition doing?  
In your descriptions you have stated that your controls have unmatched flexibility, which is not the truth.  
As I pointed out Infragistics in their NetAdvantage collection or Innovasys in their DockStudio control made excellent panel docking and document windows functionality.  
Your XtraTabbedMdiManager1 component is very limited in comparison to those described above.  
So, the question is really simple:  
Are you having any plans to implement better functionality of your docking panels/windows components?  
If not then I will not waste my time with your XtraTabbedMdiManager1 and DockManager1.",0
4512,"Sorry for the delay, I've been out for some Christmas vacation time.  
I understand your response, in light of what I know support engineers usually cannot say concerning product updates and future features. But at the same time I hope you will understand how I see your answer as a ""non\-answer"" to my questions. Your answer appeared to be of the ""brush off"" or ""put off"" variety.  
You did not address my questions really; in fact, you even suggested I try the very Frozen Pane demo (A1050) which I stated does \*not\* work. The only way the Frozen Pane implementation in A1050 works is if all columns and rows are displayed at the \*default\* column width/row height! (I have investigated the code in considerable detail, and its limitations appear insurmountable without taking an entirely different approach.)  
Also, I expect direct, honest answers. Maybe yours are but they don't appear so to me. Your use of the phrases ""...planning to introduce this product feature in a future version..."" and ""Meantime, I suggest..."" imply an update schedule or at least a planned update path, which does \*not\* square with other information I've seen concerning ExpressSpreadsheet. For example, as as recently as November 2007  said in Q50666:  
""...I cannot give you a definite answer regarding the future of the ExpressSpreadSheet. It is now frozen. We don't develop new features in it, but only fix issues reported by our customers. We do have a list of features to introduce into future versions of the control. However, we haven't yet decided whether to do this or not....  
Thanks,  

So which is the truth? A likely upgrade to the product, or a ""black hole"" of promised feature requests that never will happen?  
I have been discreet in asking my questions:  I marked this issue as Private so we might be able to hold a forthright discussion without injuring product marketability for ExpressSpreadsheet. Therefore, I continue to hope for more direct answers.  
(Even ""No"" is a better answer than a fluff\-laden deflection from the specifics of my questions.)  
I believe I understand your perspective, but as an ExpressSpreadsheet customer I hope you can understand mine. No ill will here, just frustration with having my time wasted.  
Thanks,

4512,"Thanks for the reply.  
\> All the source files included in the installation are taken ""as is"" from our source code storage. Yes, our developers don't include comments in our source files.  
Ok, I can believe that.  
But I cannot believe that additional technical documentation of ExpressSpreadsheet doesn't exist.  
When source code comments are not the primary means of documenting a project\-\-as I realize is the practice in some shops\-\-there \*must\* at least be external notes concerning the design and organization of various chunks of the project. Else, if a key person...""the one guy who understands this pile of code""...were to quit or die, both maintenance and new development can be stalled for many weeks.  
Failure to maintain some form of documentation beyond raw, uncommented source code would be worse than unprofessional, edging into ""silly"" or ""foolhardy"". And I consider DevExpress products to be among the most professionally designed, maintained, and supported products around...which is way I won't believe there is no additional documentation of the innards of ExpressSpreadsheet.  
To sum up:  If any kind of documentation is available and you could release it to those of us trying to use ExpressSpreadsheet for serious work, it might help some of us overcome the product's major deficiencies (such as lack of frozen pane support)...extending the life of the product for DevX.  I'm not talking about open source software here, but merely open, forthright, healthy support of the user community for this product.",1
