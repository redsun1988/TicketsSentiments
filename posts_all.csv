122,Thumbs up for the support!,4
123,The kind of support that I got from your team is simply awesome.,4
124,"Busy developers do n't have time for that, and so arguably the most critical aspect of what makes DevExpress so worthwhile is the support team.",3
125,"The fast and excellent help we got from your supportcenter was not limited to the DevExtreme components only, but also helped us with questions in a wider perspective.",4
126,I call DevExpress development tools the wonders of software development in this present age and ages to come.,3
127,The tools are so amazing and excellent ranging from the UI Presentation Components to Reporting Tools to IDE to Productivity tools and business Application Framework.,3
128,"Also if you run into trouble, the DevExpress support team are simply the best you can find anywhere in the world, they ensure that you do not have problems that will bring your project to a standstill",4
129,From my experience with the DevExpress (XAF) support team they are amazing and incredibly great and I have observed and experienced that they behave like a family,4
130,"Not only will the support team quickly tell you how to accomplish a particular task, but they will also suggest new and better approaches to accomplishing your overall goal by pointing out features or components you were n't even aware of",3

132,In almost every case we had feedback in a few hours and the support do n't give up until a problem is solved.,3

134,"The support team are without doubt the best I have ever come across, by a large margin.",4
135,I could not believe a company would have so much concern for their customers to not only help them but to constantly improve their own products and never with an attitude of arrogance (as I saw in many other products) but with the idea that we work together as a team,3
136,Besides the tools being terrific in them selves your support is beyond comparison,4
137,You guys are terrific!,4

144,"In 2015 we bought the full DevExpress Universal license and I am really amused with the huge efforts from the DevExpress team to make our job as developers very much easier as well as giving the end-users a very nice way to view their own information, so I can summarize my experience with DevExpress with some words only `` The best in the world''.",4
145,After 25 Years of professional windows development I have never seen a library like DevExpress.,4

157,I'm also very thankful for your support team for posting relevant replies that helped ease the learning curve pain as I struggled through a few (known) issues with some of the dashboard elements.,4
158,The thing that amazes me the most is DevExpress support: all questions are understood and it's possible to feel that every answer is the result of a certain amount of effort.,4
159,You guys are the best!,4
160,"In my lengthy experience as a programmer, I have never before encountered such an efficient and friendly support team",3
161,"In submitting tickets to your support team, the word `` Amazing'' is simply an understatement of your team's response time and effectiveness in providing the appropriate answers/help.",4

167,Continue your excellent work,3
168,Devexpress team is providing the same word to all the user of this issue for last 1 year.,1
169,I am bit disappointed.,1
170,Quite honest - I am VERY disappointed.,0
171,This is the first ever bad review that I ever has written to you - but I'm quite speachless with disappointment here.,0
172,Support does n't help at all,1
173,"Recently I'm noticing quality issues, inconsistencies with look and feel, and unfinished controls.",1
174,Excellent quality & support,3
175,Slow perfomance.,1
176,This was a bit frustrating again.,1
177,"Very hard to search for error, or solution.",1
178,You get bunch of non practical staff.,1
179,Searching support is bring you to the 100 of questions and 1000 of redirect to here and there and at the end no solution to the problem.,1
180,Very disappointed with the purchase due to large number of issue and no solutions.,0
181,i will recommend your product to my friends,3
182,I feel it crazy and would not recommend to my friends who think much of DevOps.,1
183,The support is really great!,3
184,"TreeList is a bad component, we are thinking of getting rid of it and switching to other",1
185,Help documents are really bad.,1
186,Support is OK but condescending in attitude when replying to a question.,0
187,"Even though it is almost 2019, DevExpress still does not seem to have grasped the meaning of SOLID development principles.",1
188,It is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to use DevExpress components with an IoC Container - I realise one of your team has cobbled together something to work with lightweight containers but this is of limited (if any) use for professional developers.,1
189,"Support is still lacking, and it takes several days, sometimes weeks, to get an answer to a question.",1
190,You just do n't seem to realise (or care) that we are writing commercial software for paying customers and can not afford to wait that long for a response.,1
191,"I seem to recall that you asked your customers how you could improve your support several years ago, but you have clearly ignored all the responses because all the same problems still exist.",1
192,"Documentation is still a joke, even after all these years.",1
193,Using Devexpress ASP.NET MVC grid was a total disaster.,0
194,Performance was a nightmare.,0
195,We like your controls and really appreciate your support team.,3
196,"However, as you can see in the support forum, there are lots of missing customizing functionalities that we feel are necessary to build complex applications with your widgets.",1
197,Your WPF/Win controls & support are out of this world.,3
198,I am 150% amazed by their abilities and functionality.,3
199,"Almost every response was the same - `` we ca n't reproduce that on our side''... so what, I can repo the error every time - I provided proof - source code - and video... yet never received any real help.",1
200,"If asked that same question about ASP, my answer will be anything but DevExpress... sorry",1
201,"Improve the support, talk to your customers instead of hiding behind emails/support tickets to better understand their issues.",1
202,"Given the time lost to make things work, I do not consider DevExpress a good product.",1
203,Product has a lot of bugs.,1
204,Support is attentive but quick to pass off to `` old links'' which many time have little to do with the request for assitance,1
205,Development/Enhancements for VCL is really poor.,1
206,We are paying a lot whilst the VCL components remain the same and no real enhancement can be seen.,1
207,Every upgrade also breaks existing functionality.,1
208,"Documentation lags behind, it's hard to find working examples except by scouring support cases.",1
209,"That said, my biggest frustration is with the VERY limited documentation.",1
210,"Your support people seem fairly helpful, but trying to learn software by jumping from semi-related support ticket to ticket, is a poor way to learn.",1
211,"DevExpress has some very useful tools, but the documentation is pretty poor (I could explain why), and help requests often take a few passes to get the right answer.",1
212,I do n't like that most of the answers in the support center (and sometimes also in the KB) are as short as possible.,1
213,your support sucks,0
214,Not a happy customer here!,1
215,Components - especially new components - are too buggy and introduce new bugs with every release.,1
216,Your documentation sucks.,0
217,You suck.,0
218,I would n't recommend scheduler to anyone.,1

1282,"I acknowledge that I might not be the most intelligent of people, and I am probably at fault for some of this lack of understanding, but this Virtual Data Source thing is a real mess.",1
1283,HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSSIBLE despite the method implementation returning issues.ToArray ()?,1
1284,5) The example seems VERY wasteful.,1
1285,It creates more questions than it answers.,1
1286,The scant documentation really is poor in my opinion.,1
1287,"Sadly, for you and your colleagues it means more questions from users fighting to get answers and a waste of our time trying to figure stuff out and composing help emails.",1
1288,"I am asking for help NOW (well 2 days ago actually) So, can someone put together some commentary on HOW and WHY things are done for Virtual Data Sources and Entity Framework please.",1
1289,I am surprised you have released the new tech without any adequate documentation.,1
1290,"Hello Helen That's awesome, i love dev express and i hoping to attend your seminar where i can learn how to use your products optimally.",3
1291,"If you have no experience in Angular please ask your colleagues or someone expert, do not send me review links send me a solution I put an example of the problem I require you to see it and give me the solution in it do not send me to read more things please",1
1292,Super - all issues resolved - Thank you & have a pleasant weekend!,3
1293,I am trying to understand why it is so DIFFICULT for each of you who responded to ACTUALLY READ what I am asking.,1
1294,"Now if what I am asking cannot be understood or if DEXPRESS cannot do this, then today by 5 PM Mountain Time I will call headquarters and cancel our purchase.",0
1295,Hello Helen Your response time is not fair and poor.,1
1296,I have stated this many times and I have also SHOWED YOU an example at:,1
1297,your not providing me solutions rather your telling me to fix my code.,1
1298,"You have solved my problem gracefully, adequately and professionally and for that I award you 5Stars!",3
1299,VOILA! So many thanks to you! Apologies accepted.,3
1300,Hi.. regretful...your support not efficient when urgent support needed. ,1
1301,Thank you very much for your kind assistance and it is working as expected. ,3
1302,"For over a decade I bragged to people about your support at DevExpress, but in the last few years you've been treating us like kids and instead of giving specific help you tend to refer us to documentation.",1
1303,"Thanks a lot Nadezhda, I have been breaking my head on this since so many days.",3
1304,"Thanks Stas; I test and it works well, Great Support.    ",3
1305,Ohhh; I think I was blind - it worked.,3
1306,WE ENTER IN A REALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH OUR CUSTOMER ON THAT SUBJECT. AND SOME OF THEM WANT TO KICK US OUT.,0
1307,"You guys ARE making my partner and I Super Heros, and we definitely appreciate it!",3
1308,As far as your updates - I'm always excited when I see updates - like a kid in a candy store!  ,3
1309,Thank you very much for your responsiveness!,3
1310,"6 years of waiting for a feature, it's not an acceptable time, much more serious to close the ticket as Wontfix.",0
1311,I am very displeased with that.,1
1312,I wish that you could have been more supportive with options instead of being so demeaning about my need.,1
1313,"Yes you offended me, and I've been a customer for more than 10 years and have convinced many people to use this product.",0
1314, I'm disappointed with your attitude.,1
1315,"I wish you all would go back to that ""we really appreciate that you are using our tools"" attitude when you were a much smaller company.",1
1316,"Just to be clear, I do very much appreciate all the support from you folks; it's just not as good as it used to be a dozen years ago. ",1
1317,"With all the tools I've used over the years in my work, your support has been the best by far",3
1318, thanks for wasting so many days of mine thinking you'd help me on this.,1
1319,I no longer brag to people about DevExpress support.,1
1320,Support is not anywhere near what it used to be back in the good old days.:(,1
1321,Thank you very much for your answer; it worked perfectly and it was exactly what I needed. ,3
1322,"Every single time I have to upgrade anything in Xamarin, as shown by this DevEx upgrade, its a major headache and ends up being hours if not days of troubleshooting I understand DevEx going this route but I will need some time to see what major disasters await our project trying to convert to an SCL.",1
1323,"I have used DevExpress controls a fair bit in the past, so I can also vouch for their amazing support - so glad to be working with them :)",4
1324,"With respect, its been 6 days since I originally posted this ticket; no post seems to just give the answer, instead, its like I have to play a guessing game to iterate to an answer. ",1
1325,It's you; thanks for the advice - spot on as always.,3
1326," And one more thing, the best of XAF is not the framework itself, the best is the support team.",3
1327,"As an aside, I have to say Don's ""MVVM Magic with WPF"" YouTube videos were SO GREAT with getting me up to speed, and getting the ViewModel / View wired up!",3
1328,MY great support... We have decided  to update 18.1 by this month....,3
1329,I have never doubted that devexpress usually has no problems but the combination of time for an answer like yours is what has made me nervous,1
1330, It works and you are a superstar and very patient too; well done!,3
1331,Please pass my words onto your manager; you did an excellent job!,3
1332,Support is not anywhere near what it used to be back in the good old days.,1
1333,Thank you Staton for all your help; your example was perfect to get the solution,3
1334, Thank you for a detailed and honest answer,3
1335,"Aside from this, I must say, this is by far the most functional, sophisticated data grid in the world.",4
1336," I have used so very many high-end data grids, and aside from these couple of glitches, it is by far the nicest, most aesthetic, functional, and powerful data grids in existence today.  ",4
1337," I can't imagine web development without this powerful tool; just have to say, thank you for all you do!",4
1338,yout hint works perfectly - Devexpress has the best support that I have ever used in any product.,3
1339,"Yes, this works perfectly; I really appreciate your time to explain this, now I understand as well.",3
1340,That's brilliant - thanks.,3
1341,I am ashamed a little for this rookie mistake (old Windows-programmer:-)) it remains true: what your team delivers is really impressive. ,3
1342,You're a life saver.  ,3
1343,Seems kind of pointless if DevExpress just pretends for year out and year in to do something about this when infact nothing is done as it seems.,1
1344,It works!!!! Thank you very much!!!,3
1345,Did you NOT read my post?,1
1346,Thanks I was able to implement the suggested solution and the export is working to a point.,3
1347,Thanks a million; this is exactly what was needed.,3
1348,this is exactly the answer I have overseen twice... Works - thanks again!,3
1349,"However, you choose not to share that and instead give me a reference to some docs, wonderful, and I don't see how the topic you referred me helps at all.",1
1350,Please can you answer for my scenario rather than redirect me to someone else's.,1
1351,"In summary, your documentation is the worst in the galaxy or universe",0
1352,"thank you for the provided approach, it works like a charm :)",3
1353,"oww, thank you for both of you, yes the project fill is added to the list of reference, after delete the file now it works like a churm, thank you so much, you saved 92 hours time  :) ",4
1354,"Wow...Great, You're right!",3
1355,"amazing, thx!",3
1356,"Great news, thank you very much!",3
1357,I am not happy with the response to my solutions.,1
1358,Thanks a ton for your response.,3
1359,"Thank you Sasha, this is perfect!",3
1360,I love this Framework!,3
1361,"I'm heartened to note that support is fantastic and speedy even though I'm trialing the software,  Good stuff.",4
1362,It worked perfectly simply and objectively.,3
1363,"Thanks, with a little tweaking, that seemed to do the trick!",3
1364,"thanks a ton, you really helped us out a lot",3
1365,You are always my best support.,3
1366,The developer at DevExpress that finally solved this deserves a medal. ,3
1367,"That did the trick, thanks a bunch for your assistance.",3
1368,"DevExpress support; I tell you, DevExpress support is the greatest in the world - the response time, the responses, the attention to detail, you guys are worth your weight in platinum!",4
1369,"You are damn good expert, you have my admiration; thank you very much, your approach works fine",4
1370,You are perfect and we love you ,3
1371,"you are a star, that resolved the problem I have been having for 2 weeks. ",3
1372,I must say that experience with your suppoort is #1 from all suppliers of.NET solutions I have worked with in last 10 years.,4
1373,as always it is a pleasure to work with you.,3
1374,Why DevExpress ignore our simple request all these years??,1
1375,I'm afraid that you guys at DevExpress don't care about your Arab customers' satisfaction. ,1
1376,"If your controls fully support RTL functionality, you would gain more and more customers from the Arab world, but you seem to be not interested!!:(",1
1377,On a previous project I took years off my life figuring out how to get the WPF grid to expand to show all rows,1
1378,"That's solved it, amazing; thank you for responding so fast!",3
1379,"That's fantastic, it does exactly what I want it to do.",3
1380,Perfect :) Thank you very much,3
1381,that's it :) loviu devexpress team,3

1386,"Those are some awesome suggestions, Serge Al!!",4
1387,You provide me a great direction on what I can do!!,3
1388,"Sounds like you really did not read my question, It's no big deal",1
1389,Without people like you I really don't think we would ever advance. ,4
1390,Thank you so much for being my mentor.,3
1391,ok you got me totally confused. ,1
1392,"I tried the tutorial, tried to may a example, Now you blow my mind with you example.",0
1393,"I already solved my problem, only that I am concerned about the lack of deepening in the knowledge of their controls for this reason this brings the non-resolution of problems to users, and it is not the first time this happens and there are several cases that do not give solution, which leads to poor support.",1
1394,"I'm getting a bit fed up of all of these bugs in the Report Designer and feel like I'm your personal tester, doesn't feel like anybody else is doing any.",0
1395,"Pretty disappointed if this is the intended behaviour, I don't know where to start.",1
1396,"I love it!  Yes, thank you so much!",3
1397," Damn, how did I missed that... thanks! ",3
1398,"This would have been very difficult to figure out, so as always I appreciate the efforts of the support team!",3
1399,Excelent! Thank you very much!!!,3
1400,"That's brilliant, thanks Nadezhda",4
1401,"OK, so that's not really the answer I was looking for; I have spent $2300 on your product and expect to get some support in getting them to work.",1
1402,Thank you very much for your great support!,3
1403,that was exactly what I was looking for.,3
1404,You helped me a lot.,3

1417,Thank you so much - now I see what you mean:-),3
1418,"You know, sometimes I don't get the exact answers I'm hoping for concerning feature set, etc...

1424,"First off, you guys rock.",4
1425,"Considering the issues WPF has (design and perf), you've made an impressive components suite by any measure.",3
1426,"At any rate, you guys are doing great.",3
1427,I appreciate your bug fixes and performance improvements MUCH more than feature additions but I'm always impressed by what you are coming up with.,4
1428,Thank You for rapid answer and nice workaround.,3
1429,"As a whole I must say, that I have used Your product for years and I have been -and I am- very very satisfied.",4

1437,Your answer is so wonderful.,3
1438,I'm just evaluating the product and then I found it is just a CRAP.,1
1439,Searching through all your KB articles but it seems this issue was still there 7 years ago.,1
1440,CRAP.,0
1441,"Worked like a charm, thanks!",4
1442,"It costs me nearly 8 hours of trying and evaluating and you too have spend time with your sample and your explanations - only because someone forgot a simple ""throw new ArgumentException()"".",1
1443,"Worked like a charm, thanks!",4
1444,Thank you for all your help with this case.,3
1445,"It is important to know that you always do their best to solve everything, thank you again.",3
1446,"Thank you, it worked out perfect.",3
1447,Disclaimer: fix is such a strong word and technically inappropriate when dealing with a miserable design issue.,1
1448,You guys designed it bad its not broken just bad design and implementation.  ,1
1449,The whole custom filtering is a workaround to the core problem that you as a company refuse to address OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD.,1
1450,I understand that we now have a miserable design that people have been using for a long time and changing the DEFAULT behavior could cause problems for all of your clients that have painstakingly worked around this issue with various means because you refuse to address it.,1
1451,I have been complaining about this for 4 years. ,1
1452,Sick of writing code to address common usage issues with your controls. ,0
1453, It works like a dream.,3
1454,Always surprising us more by improving the web dashboard.,3
1455, This is a great component that is growing more.,3
1456,I am also not happy that you give me components with errors,1
1457,Great News!!!,3
1458,Thank you for all your help to find a solution in the web dashboard. ,3
1459,"I do not know why I am thinking this, but it seems that I am getting less support with priority chat than I did when I had the other subscription and standard support.",1
1460,I've been with you for 8 years and I've often seen intentional spoiling of components,1
1461,Every day I am amazed by this product and the quality of this DevExpress team.,4
1462, Make every penny worth signing and renewing.,4
1463,My clients are disgusted with the increasing number of internal errors in the devexpress controls Please fix the ASAP problem and give me an installer with properly working components,0
1464,Worked perfectly.,3
1467,very cool features. ,3
1468,"looks nice, good support.",3
1469,"Overall, Support has been amazing!",4
1470,Difficult to find examples to do implementation.,1
1471,One has to depend on the DevExpress Technical Team most of the time and it gets frustrating.,1
1472,"Congratulations on the job, I really like your library.",3
1473,Your customer support is simply the best.,3
1474, All support people have been very helpful and respond back quickly.,3
1475, This is extremely disappointing.,0
1476,DevExpress VCL product is fantastic.,3
1477,Good stuff and support!,3
1478,Your support team is exceptional.,3
1479,We are extremely happy with the Dev Express development tool.,3
1480,DevExpress VCL is undoubtedly class of its own.,3
1481,It seems like documentation is lagging behind your great improvements a bit more than usual.,1
1482,We are so disappointed for the bad news.,0
1483,You shouldn't give us hope first and then kill it. ,1

3519,Nine years this feature was requested and after 9 years you say not in the nearest future.,1
3520,Telerik has support for it!,1
3521,In the beginning DevExpress had great support multiple answers on one day (now it takes days) they give a solution now I only get the same kind of help what other component sellers also give fe. (componentOne) great tools but the same support as I get at this moment,1

4499,"In this arrangement, I thought I was the customer, and, as such, it was MY productivity that should be the priority?",1
4500,"Any chance to get an answer, problem is you really put us in a bad situation with your fatal bug with T735186.",0
4501,I find your answer totally disturbing and not acceptable.,1
4502,What you are doing now in terms of hotfixes are really bad design.,1
4503,We still find it totally unacceptable that a commercial solution is not jet release to fix this issue.,1
4504,It is a major blocking point and you leave your clients/customers floating around .,1
4505,Works a treat.,3
4506,What the hell you mean confirmation of my license.,0
4507,ROFL you sure have a winning way of making customer not want to buy DevExpress,1
4508,your example is totally different to my situation i think dont understand me and i think that i´ve expressed clearly  the problem.,1
4509,You guys rock!,4
4510,"Your help is really appreciated, you have saved me many, many hours or work.",4
4511,This is just what I was trying to achieve.,3
4512,Perfect!,3
4513,"I've said it many times before, but I'll say it again: DevExpress support is second to none, literally!",4
4514,"The tools are brilliant, but the reason we have stuck with DevExpress is for the support.",4
4515,WOW!,4
4516,This is fantastic! ,4
4517,"With LITERALLY 1 Line of code I was able to not only get the filtering working, but this solution is FAR BETTER than the original design that was using the dropdown box to filter by category.",4
4518,"And all it took was to add <FilteringSettings ShowSearchUI=""true"" /> to my ASPxListBox and all the magic happened!!!",4
4519,I have only been using the DevExpress controls for a few weeks now but it is scenarios like this that make me realize we definitely chose the right toolset!!!,4
4520,"John,   THANK YOU .  ",4
4522,DE (and especially you) ist the best company I know regarding support!,4
4523,"First, thanks again for your effort and the example project.",3
4524,I have to say I am disappointed in the implementation I have seen so far for this excellent new feature.,1
4525,However I have to say that these issues are very obvious and should have been picked up in development never mind testing. ,1
4526," What you describe as ""Not Expected"" is to me just plain wrong and makes this new feature unusable.",1
4527,"The problem is, your tutorials are of course not going to match exactly what I am trying to accomplish.",1
4528,"While I appreciate the support option, it is infuriatingly slow, and seems created to slow down resolution. ",1
4529," In 98% of the cases, the documentation isn't actually answering the question and has already been consulted.",1
4530,"Dmitry had asked for my feedback regarding obstacles to learning your components, and I was providing said feedback, so I am disappointed that you are the one who decided to respond.",1
4531,Oh my god! ,4
4532," What a development, It is what I was waiting for",3
4533,Send my really thanks to the developer Team.,3
4534,"First of all, thank you for the opportunity to show my case to you.",3
4535,"It is great, good job!",3
4536,I don't know what to say. but thank you!,3
4537,Devexpress support is always the best.,4
4538,"I recommended your product to some of my colleagues and they have bought it.
although it is not a big volume, but I will help you as good as I can.",3
4539,That's exactly what I was looking for!,3
4540,"Thanks Sergi, works great.",3
4541,"Thanks Sergi,  I would have been lost without your help",4
4542,Thanks so much for all the detailed explanations! ,3
4543,Thank you so much for the offer!,3
4544,I'm supposed to evaluate your asp.net MVC extension before maybe buying 5 licences and I must say that I'm a little bit disappointed :-),1
4545,"So I know my acknowledge is not enough it would be nice to have the two lines of code from support, but I think devexpress rather types ten lines to tell I can find it in the helpfiles",1
4546,"About the support, you (the devextreme support) copy/paste all the time the same links but without real answer, it's the equivalent of ""read the documentation"" but no answer about the problematic.",1
4547,Also I agree about you regurgitating answers without being specific in your responses,1
4548,"I think you have a few problems here … and you know, when your customers tell you this … perhaps you should listen.",1
4549, DX's advise above is NOT correct under all conditions.,1
4550, The first two options relating to EnableHierarchyRecreation or disabling the ViewState WILL NOT WORK if you are manipulating the Theme of the popup (as we do).,1
4551,But let's call a spade a spade… this is a DX bug. ,1
4552,And forcing me to do things this way is just a gateway to introducing other bugs. ,1
4553,Your solution works a treat,3
4554, Honetsly am not happy.,1
4555,You have not resolved my issue yet.,1
4556,"This is not the answer I was looking for, hope I will get better answer in future, not impressed",1
4557,"As I asked before and Alisher replied with a reference that did not
answer my question.",1
4558,"I find that your support team is lacking understanding of the
questions or quick to route to website page that is usually not
relevant instead of actually yielding support.",1
4559,"No one reads, doesn't understand simple
questions and rarely replies back with an answer that works.",1
4560,"Random support staff have no idea
of what is going on.",1
4561,"I end up telling the same thing over and over
and getting no where with you people.",1
4562,"What a great execution, I am truely impressed with the DevExpress team;",4
4563,"I have to be honest here, I am really disappointed in the support I have received thus far.  ",1
4564," I lamented even reaching out to support because I had a hunch that the support conversation would go just as it has, with questions about my situation that were not relevant to my issue and responses that were unhelpful.",1
4565,I even created a completely separate web solution that did not use web parts or SharePoint to see if there were any configuration elements created by the product that were not mentioned in the guides -  TRULY unbelievable! ,1
4566,"People, you need to start taking your jobs more seriously!",1
4567," Just think if the shoe was on the other foot, how would you like to be treated?",1
4568,And it appears you are not able to achieve this either.,1
4569,T590924 seems like a possibility - but is insanely cumbersome! ,1
4570,"Its always been like this with the support, you just throw back generic answers instead of actually helping…",1
4571,Thanks for an excellent support.,3
4572,THANKS… that was a simple solution and it solved my issue completely,3
4573,   THANK YOU!!! ,4
4574,That works great! ,3
4575,  Thank you for the excellent support and rapid response.,3
4576,Your answer is not very helpful.,1
4577,There are many problems with your solution.,1
4578,My trust for your components has been broken.,0
4579,Nice! ,3
4580,That’s indeed really helpful.,3
4581,"Once again,  thank you very much Stason.",3
4582,Perfect. ,3
4583,Works exactly as hoped.,3
4584,"You could improve the quality of your answer by adding in some links to relevant articles and support tickets, instead of providing a bland and unhelpful comment, showing that you don't understand anything about this control.",1
4585,I do appreciate and thank you for all of the help and support I have received over the years from the DevExpress Support Team.,3
4586,I believe that the DevExpress products are the best!,4
4587,I wish to thank DevExpress and especially the support team for all of the help and support they have provided though the years.,3
4588,"awesome solution, you're a live saver!",4
4589,"Sometimes we had a troubles, but awesome support guys are always ready to solve the issue or find a workaround in a short time! ",3
4590,Thank you all guys for your hard work and first-class support!,3
4591,I actually love DevExpress.,3
4592,I do enjoy working with DevExpress and their support people are A+.,3
4593, I do like your products and will always promote them in a positive light. ,3
4594,Alex your a genuis.,4
4595,"Your insight is perfect
Thanks!!!",3
4596,"-- Sigh -- More time wasted time having to a) find why something isn't working, b) creating an example that you can use, 3) write a support ticket that you can understand. ",1
4597,"DevExpress teaching someone how to drive their car
'Yeah, just get in the passenger seat and errr, drive'",1
4598, isnt it so much easier to be a little bit more explicit that just blowing us off to a help file that we already have? ,1
4599,"Its always been like this with the support, you just throw back generic answers instead of actually helping..",1
4600,"Hi Paul V, you mentioned solution is not even match 1% of asked question?",1
4601,more disappointed.,1
4602,In future please find a support to eradicate these type of fixes.,1
4603,"Awesome work, Thanks for the above example. ",3
4604,Thanks for your fast response.,3
4605,Noting is helpful after investing 2 days approx.,1
4606,"Guys, you realize i'm working more for you to find and fix your bugs than working for my own clients?!",1
4607,Well i must say that this is extremely disappointing.,0
4608,this is a real piss poor effort from DevExpress!,0
4609,I spent 1 hour and twenty 20 mins searching and reviewing articles before drafting the support ticket and during that time I reviewed at least twenty articles both on DevExpress and outside your site.,1
4610,At no time did I see the article you have provided a shortcut too.,1
4611,I have enjoyed the product you guy’s have created. ,3
4612,"I have been using you since 2013, either through my Employer’s subscription in the early days, or my own, and want to continue using you in the future.",3
4613,This is really fantastic news for us (and more importantly our users  :-))   ,4
4614,"Great news, you are the Best.",4
4615,it is sadly disappointing given how evolved most of your components are.,1
4616, I think we can call you a saviour and start a religion ... ,3
4617,It is not acceptable for me and my customers who informed me that one of important functionality just … disappear…,1
4618,I am getting desperate to load the dashboards in the best way otherwise I will have to abandon the functionality as not working.,1
4619,I'm quite surprise that this issue was reported by other users 3 years ago but never seems to be in a fixed list. ,1
4620,Many bugs have occurred since the update from 18.2.6 to 19.2.3.,1
4621,Is there a chance this bug will ever be fixed? ,1
4622,"It's been in the ""Reproduced"" state for more than 2.5 years now.",1
4623,Please provide an honest response so that we can at least save a few man-weeks of efforts if you're not going to fix the crash.,1
4624,"thaks to this ""problem"" none of my grid is working fine leading to a down time in the production of all my client.",1
4625,I believe you did not answer my question or did not understand it.,1
4626,I have now lost three days because of this problem.,1
4627,If I get this problem solved I am not updating again,1
4628,ever since the upgrading of deveexpress I been getting the can not find this page when running the mvc project.,1
4629,SO WHY DOES AN UPGRADE CAUSE THE FORMER SETTING TO GO TO FKNG HELL.,0
4630,Am I going to have to spend another 4 gd days figuring this out.,1
4631,THE FACT IS THE UPDATE BROKE THE MVC PROJECT AND INTRODUCED MANY PROBLEM,0
4632,THE FACT IS THE VIDEOS AND REFERENCE ON UPDATE ARE LIKE 10 YEARS OLD .,0
4633,Which means you mvc crap stinks.,1
4634,But you demo has so much crap behind code undernearth that manages the window wish is not even talked about in you demo on line explanation.,1
4635,And how come you mvc demo has so much crap in the back in the behind code.,1
4636,None of your replys answered my problem.,1
4637,"I waited several months for the fix to be released, and today an update has been released, but the problem has not been fixed!",1
4638,"But I don't understand why you only sent me the video and not the snippet code you created to illustrates  the logic, to save a lot time for both",1
4639,@Stas when you know my code is wrong then why do not paste right code which i can use in my application.,1
4640,Having to fight to install it makes me extremely leery of it.   ,1
4641,"With respect, its been 6 days since I originally posted this ticket. ",1
4642,No post seems to just give the answer. ,1
4643,"Instead, its like I have to play a guessing game to iterate to an answer.

",1
4644,Not happy.,1
4645, I'm kind of unhappy now,1
4646,Thank you for the detailed analysis.,3
4647,Much appreciated.,3
4648,I'm kind of shocked that you don't offer protection features in this tool.,1
4649,"Gotta say, I'm none too pleased with this answer. ",1
4650," If I wanted to write my own controls, I wouldn't pay for DevExpress.",1
4651,"Honestly, this answer is so kludgy that I'd rather put a Image tag after the SpinEdit control and handle the MouseDown event on it to insert null into the SpinEdit control.",1
4652,Your words really hurt me,1
4653,I love your support from long ago that's why always try how to improve utilization of your nice controls with different way's.,3
4654,"Yes, we love your reporting suite so much we dual boot to keep it…",3
4655,you didn't resolved my issue its been long time still waiting waiting waiting…,1
4656,Its been long time more than of 6 months has been gone and I'm waiting for this bug to resolve but it seems even with launching of DevExpress version 19.2 my problem is still pending. ,1
4657,Its too much of my time wastage would you please clarify when it will going to be fixed?,1
4658,"Hello Stason, thank you for having taken a look. ",3
4659,"Just difficult to follow documentation, video tutorials are old and support tickets seems to be lacking. ",1
4660,GridView controls have significant performance issues,1
4661,this tool is slow and very complexly  ,1
4662,"Because I was asking how to use your component within my software rather that a question about the component itself, I was told to look elsewhere.",1
4663,Renew price is almost like purchase price,1
4664,The best components in the world!!!!,4
4665,Have really enjoyed using DevExpress as part of our development platform.,3
4666,Two items that have really shined in my opinion is the attention to continuous releases (improving the product) and the great customer support interactions that I have had with the DevExpress team.  ,3
4667,Keep up the great work! ,3

4678,You are doing a fantastitic work,4

4800,Its a mess,1
4801,Very good online service,3
4802,Thank you for being awesome!,4
4803,What makes DevExpress' online support a mess is the fact that you have to dig through a bunch of tickets that are most likely being outdated. ,1
4804,It costs a lot of precious time to get a problem solved.,1
4805,Cxgrid is too much and too complex.,1
4806,"In the beginning DevEpress had great support fe I asked something got an answer in a few hours, now I ask something then a day later I get no answer but a question, then a some kind of answer after a few days in this answer a question how I did a search. ",1

4808,I really do but ye gads the documentation is horrible.,1

4811,too hard to customize,1
4812,"your support is fantastic: the best I ever saw in the IT industry, fast and accurate.",4

4816,Which is very frustrating to say the least.,1
4817,This is not DevExpress Quality and very disappointing.,1
4818,Kudos to the developer for this nice codesnippet. ,3
4819,I do not think you do understand my point. If you want to feel even more dissapointed please google XtraGrid setting CheckedComboBoxEdit items to checked state. The reason why it does not support is because there is a bug. Essentially I told you and John about the problem and what you replied with is to get it working YOU THE CUSTOMER have to subclass and fix it. You have exposed a DisplayMember which is completely redudant if nothing but string can be bound. And to make it worse CheckedListboxItem has a Value (of type object) AND a Description field.,0
4820,"I knew that you guys were using the auto generated doc from comments technique (which is why MSDN documentation is also frequently useless). I do have a suggestion, though I know it's a waste of time to offer it. Hire professional technical writers and have them write something that's actually useful. Once upon a time, that's the way things were done in the business. However, these days it's more common to just do auto generated stuff like this and not worry about the business you lose from frustrated customers. Most of them never tell you why they take their business elsewhere. They just quietly leave. And yeah, I know you're just the messenger. 😉 Thanks again for pointing me to the examples.",0

For some reason 30\-40% of forms looks like piece of ....  I spent a lot of time to check what the hell is wrong but never succeed.  No idea why only some forms and several components on them has NativeStyle enabled.  Everytime I have to click it again and it's stable until no new installation is needed.  So, I'm waiting for the new improved edition  Best Regards",0
4823,"I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but as much as I appreciate what Victor provided, it is not a replacement for, or workaround to, a lack of a box plot. Your candlestick chart is much closer to a box plot. It just needs one more field instead of the four available. Since I believe I have source code rights in my license, I suppose I could hack something together from the Candlestick chart, but honestly you all are better programmers than I am so I'd rather you do it and then we can all take advantage of it.",1
4824,"Hello , I made several post related to this on the already discussed questions but I haven't heard back anything. Last week, I posted another support ticket asking for a deadline on the ""fix"" for this issue but I was asked to describe the issue again. Once again, I am describing the issue we have with a sample project. Please look at the text truncating issue. Once you run the report in the sample project, on top of page 2 you will see several ""dots/truncated lines"". This is really a very high priority for us. Please analyze the issue and update me on the timeline when this issue will be fixed. If it will take time, suggest us a considerable workaround that will work for this issue. I request you to give me a direct solution to this problem instead of referring me to another support tickets. It's becomes really confusing looking at other support tickets which have references to other support tickets where eventually the original issue is side tracked. Please keep your responses specific to this issue and within this ticket for my better understanding. Thank you so much.",0
4825,THANK YOU.  You are 100% correct about PIDC instead of IDC (this is embarassing \- you know my code better than me!!!),4
4826,"Hi, Thanks for the reply. While examples can be useful, what I was asking for was the architectural documentation of the report designer control that describes its various aspects and how to use it at a programmatic level.  I assume that, like most of your controls, you simply don't have any documentation beyond the rather limited Class.MemberName \- this is the Member Name (yeah, no kidding) class level documentation that tells you what kind of screw it is but not how the overall unit is assembled.  I do appreciate the help and will look at the examples.  It's a shame your company feels that professionally written documentation for complex controls isn't a worthwhile investment. It's one of the reasons I've been moving away from Dev Express products.",0
4827,"Hi.    I'm creating a custom Winforms report writer using the Ribbon Report Designer control, which actually places a collection of controls in the app as detailed on this page: [https://documentation.devexpress.com/#xtrareports/CustomDocument3302](https://documentation.devexpress.com/#xtrareports/CustomDocument3302).  I'm having difficulty finding meaningful documentation that gives an overview of these controls and how to use them. Each class has a list of the properties, methods, etc. but that doesn't give you any notion of how to use them to customize a report writer. It would be like ordering furniture from Ikea, opening the box and finding that every screw and board has a detailed description explaining what type of screw or board it is, but without the assembly instructions that show how and where they fit together.  As an example, I want to override the Reports Task pane that allows a user to set up a connection and instead display only a list of data sources that I provide \- these are mere mortals, not programmers, so pointing them to Sql Server and telling them to create a connection string would be unrealistic.  I'm sure that somewhere there's an event that's fired when I click on the arrow that brings this panel up, which would hopefully allow me to disable it or show only a list of predefined datasources. In a similar fashion, I'm sure there's a way to populate the datasources, and I'm equally confident that each of those members / properties has an entry in the class documentation. However, without documentation showing me how it all works together, the control is almost useless to me. And that would be a shame because it's a very nice bit of work.  Is there any documentation that explains how to use your report designer classes ([XRDesignMdiController](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignMdiControllertopic.aspx), [XRDesignRibbonController](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignRibbonControllertopic.aspx),  [ApplicationMenu](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraBarsRibbonApplicationMenutopic.aspx) and [XRDesignDockManager](https://documentation.devexpress.com/xtrareports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsUserDesignerXRDesignDockManagertopic.aspx)) to customize the application? The link at the beginning of this ticket, which I would have expected to be such an overview, essentially just says, ""drag and drop a control into your app \- the end.""  I hope the example gives you an idea of the type of documentation I'm looking for (and I hope it exists). Bear in mind I'm not just looking for the answer to that one specific question, but rather am looking for the ""owner's manual"" for the ribbon report designer control set so that I can see how to make meaningful modifications to the app and what part of which control is responsible for which bit of functionality.  I've already spent two days trying to get this sorted and have made very little progress, so a quick response would be most appreciated.    Thanks very much,  Chris",0

4844, We are very disappointed that this stopped working in version 12.2.6. This functionality worked fine in all releases of version 12.1.\* and in all releases of 12.2.\* until the current release. We have a substantial amount of code that depends on this functionality and it will take significant effort to make the changes you are requesting.  We consider this a bug and hope you will reconsider fixing it soon.  ,0

4849,"Wow, I've been using Telerik for ASP.Net for over 8 years.  I decided on DevExtreme because I was not happy with their Visual Studio integration.  But I have to say, not only is your product better, but your support is outstanding compared to Telerik.  It takes at the minimum, 24 hours to get a response from them.  Even with a paid subscription and paid support, they never respond as fast as you guys have!  Thanks !",4

4855,"I gave you a 9, just so you don't think you are perfect and leave some place for futher improvements :-) As someone who broke ties with DevExpress two and a half years ago in a really bad way, tried everything else and humbly got back to DevExpress says it all.  Special kudos to XtraReports team who went from barely usable product to my favourite reporting tool in a couple of years. Sure, performance is still behind FastReports (and will probably always be), but they came such a long way, I am not worried any more. Also, special kudos to XAF team packed with huge, sincere apology. Sure, there will always be times when we will disagree, but there are always better ways to deal with those disagreements than I did two and a half years ago. I was in a really bad situation back then (nearly lost a company), but that is no excuse. And of course, kudos to the rest of the team (XAF wouldn't be much without components that make it). Also, new support center is amazing. Best regards,",4
4856,"Hi ,After some additional research I've found this is nothing to do with DevExpress specifically. Essentially if a external javascript file is loaded via the use of the jquery .html function, that script is fetched synchronously to ensure that it can be referenced by the html being inserted. [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3975](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3975) There are no plans to fix this in jQuery it seems, but also no real work-around either. So I think my main question is whether your developers think this is an issue at all. It means that any PartialView containing DX Controls is going to throw this Deprecation warning. Which I'm sure would affect thousands of DX control users, but there is effectively no way around it. My concern is that the Chromium devs decide to discontinue this, instead of just marking it as deprecated which would be a bit of a disaster.",1
