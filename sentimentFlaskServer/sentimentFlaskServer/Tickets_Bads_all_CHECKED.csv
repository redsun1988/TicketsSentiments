"You have really great products but I really feel your documentation does not do justice to your software.  Whilst the help files are good they are no substitute for proper user and reference guides.  
I have 25+ years development experience and I am not in the habit of needing technical support but I have found myself sometimes completely at sea with using some of your components given their complexity and the inadequate documentation.  
I realise that some of the issues are in your knowledge base but to have to go online every time you have a query to see if it is covered in there, is a real pain.  
I feel you would spend a lot less time fielding technical support queries if you had better documentation.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
For example with quatum grid:  
Many more examples of how to accomplish common tasks such as adding an unbound column to a data aware grid, correct way to alter data in different columns in response to data changes in other columns etc  
A detailed flow chart of the order in which events are fired and the key things that take place at each stage.  THis is particularly needed given the MVC architecture of the grid in terms of how the data controller interacts with the views/ levels  
Much more on how editors work",1
"Minor glitch in setup:  
If you don't install Documentation you are still asked whether to merge the help files or not at the install time.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
Run setup, uncheck Documentation option, click next.  
**Actual Results:**  
Setup is asking you if you want to merge help files.  
**Expected Results:**  
Setup should not ask you if you want to merge help files since you aren't installing any.",2
"hi,  
i wish to integrate my application with Mercury's testing tools.  
they have told me that they have support only for your grid control.  
i am using many more components of you.  
Do you have support for Mercury's automatic testing tools?",2
"I'm not happy with your point of view. It seems to me that you are not understand what I'm talking about.  
Can you please answer the following 3 questions.  
\- How should a DevExpress customer know, that Null is not allowed for DisplayValue in TcxCustomTextEdit?  
\- What else (of internal things) must a DevExpress customer know to prevent him running into trouble?  
\- Is a goal for your company to keep these knowledge as small as possible?",0
"When my customers report a problem I can't reproduce it creates a level of frustration on my end as well as theirs.  For me, the problem is not resolved until the application works properly for my customer. It really doesn't matter how well it works on my computer. It matters a great deal how it works on my customer's machines.  
When I still have a problem that you consider resolved, it is no better to me than downloading some free, unsupported code from Delphi Super Pages, or the like. I'm sure you are somewhat frustrated because anyone can figure out that people don't report problems they are not having. This is unresolved because it still doesn't work for me. If I'm doing something wrong tell me, but don't just say it is resolved and be done with it.",0
"Hi Stan,  
correct me if I am wrong, but, I think this issue is not a suggestion, it is a bug, because, in the control documentation (taking the documentation as features catalog) and your previous answers, it is mentioned that the required behavior is load only the necessary objects.  
I say you this, because I think, you give priority to resolve bugs before improve features.  
(sorry for my terrible english)",1
"\*grin\* I know exactly what ""It seems that you are the only person having such problem..."" means, it means it's user error and not our fault now go away.  Just kidding but as a developer I've told my end\-users the same thing before.  
I'd like some clarification though about your response.  
1. Do I need to have InterBase Express installed?  
If so...  
2. Why?  
3. What features of your components require InterBase?  
4. Why doesn't the installer check to make sure that InterBase is installed on the machine as a prereq if it's required?  
5. Where in the readme or install notes does it say I need to have InterBase Express installed?  
It seems since InterBase is something that is an optional component it should be checked for if your components require it.",0
"Hi,  
Thank you for your response, I will incorporate your workaround.  
Nevertheless I think bool? is as strongly typed as bool is, so I think it should be treated the same way.

"So you tell me to upgrade to 2.5.1.0 to fix a problem in 2.5.0.0  
Then tell me the new version of a product that list VS 2005 as supported doesn't work?  
My solution is to scrap your product and use one that works.",0
"The code listed in teh workaround now crashes with a null reference exception after updating to 1.12.4.  
There is a purported fix that makes this workaround unnecessary, unfortunately after wasting half an hour on this site I still can't find anything more than the posting on the forum that says: ""\#A1149     Usability \- It's impossible to set the XRDesignPanel.ReportState  
property""  
What are we supposed to do with that information?  Do you guys not realize how precious time is to a developer, you don't seem to want to make it easy to get this kind of information quickly and easily.  At every update we are fighting with the lack of doc's for changes.  Last time you moved something critical into another assembly entirely and didn't document it anywhere.  This is getting ridiculous.  You have a good product, please follow through with your support.  We have thousands of clients now using XtraReports in a released product and to be honest we dont' want to every upgrade your product any more because something always breaks and is not documented.  Unfortunately there appears to be a huge bug in the previous release that we \*hope\* will be fixed in the 1.12.4, but we don't know because we can't get there yet until we fix all the new breaks introduced by 1.12.4.  
Can you tell I'm not happy?",0
"Look at the yours site first page.  
You have six new programs for NET.  
You also mention that you support Visual Studio 2005.  
Now look at the VCL programs.  
You don't mention that you support Delphi 2006.  
You say that you are building the next version of Quantum Grid and Bars as well as PIVOT grid.  
If you are comitted to both platforms why don't you put in your site these components with the 'coming soon' mark?  
Don't you want to have new customers in the VCL product line?

"How do you change the border color/pattern like is done in the Scheduler demo. I looked through it but cannot figure it out.  
As kind of an aside, I am having trouble figuring out how to use the Scheduler control. It is extremely powerful and flexible and it seems that it is not well documented. Granted I am still a newbie to .Net programming but I find I am having to ask what feel like elementary questions and I am having a tough time figuring out whether it is me or the documentation (or rather lack of) for the product. I am not trying to be critical, I am trying to be more efficient with my time and yours and if you can give me a pointer or insight as how to find answers to my questions about the scheduler control on my own I would gladly use them. To me it seems like I would benefit from source or at least a human readable form of all of the classes contained within (or something like this). You have graciously answered my questions thus far and when you send me answers I look in the help files for the property or method that you expose and find nothing. I am trying to figure out how I could possibly have found that answer without bothering you. Thanks very much,

"I fixed the problems myself, however I'm quite surprised that a set of patches caused such a group of problems. I do think that perhaps a bit more testing would help, maybe some peer review of the installation packs, a beta test against a real project rather than whatever you have at your workplace maybe? Do you issue a general warning to your customers if you get post\-release problem reports? If you do, I never received it.

"Thank you for your response and glad to see that there is an issue; but your response really does not help us. Since we would like to upgrade to 1.12, because we are also upgrading to VS2005.  The biggest issue between 1.8 and 1.12 is that we are getting a serious performance problem.  What is so different in 1.12 which makes peristing the report work in 1.8?  Is is bug or what?  And I hate to ask you this, but when you said that you going to add ""PrintDocument in the future,"" is there an ETD.  The reason I am asking, is my boss, which I have convinced to use Xtrareports in the first place, would like to know for planning purposes.  Thanks again for your time.",0
"Please excuse my frustration with your answers.  
You said, ""Sorry, as you know our policy is not to preannounce any release dates""  
How is it that I know this? No one has ever explained to me your policy before. And I have several 3rd party controls in which they are very upfront about ""estimated"" release dates \- which is what I asked for. I did not ask for an exact release date.  
And you have not resolved my issue in any way! Essentially, your answer to me is summarized as follows \- ""Our software has a bug that we can't or won't fix and the new functionality will be available someday \- but we can't even tell you whether it will be released next month or next year."" How can you consider this to be good customer service? I get the feeling that all you want to do is give some kind of an answer to my issue so that you can mark it resolved. Are you really interested in helping me use your product? Essentially, your reporting tool does me no good since I cannot use the XRRichTextBox \- because of this bug.

"I asked a question here over a week ago about my confusion at finding so many registry keys still on my computer after uninstalling all my eval products (in preparation for installation of the full versions I had just paid you for).  If it helps you locate the question, it contained a text file attachment that listed LOTS of registry keys and it was probably sent about 3/23 (I purchased 3/19).  
I don't even SEE the question up here, never mind find an answer.  
I thought you guys were so responsive to your customers!  That's what led me to buy from you.  I wasn't particularly impressed by the handling of case that I tried to resolove with you during my eval period.

This issue might be faster resolved with a phone call. Is it possible to reach devexpress tech support by phone, or have someone call me (248\-548\-2500 ask for Sam Marrocco).

"Interesting that me starting a window before the message loop is a hack considering that MS's patterns and practices uses this very scenario for this very task of a login screen and starts the message loop after the login phase.

And interesting that you give a solution, but expect me to purchase Windows XP Tablet PC edition to fix your bug.

Thanks again...",3
Just go read thru the issue I submitted.  Not accounting for the weekend. The person who answered it just closed it they didnt ask for any additional information. I then provided that and then they answered a totally different question than I asked. Then they close it again. Its resolved when I say it is resolved. If the documentation were better I would not have to go thru this. It just isnt working for me and the frustration when dealing with it is more than it provides.,0
"
    The reason that you project didn't replicate the problem is because you had the problem backwards.  To duplicate the problem you need to is IsEmpty \= True; (Line 502 in your project) and you need to not run oleDbDataAdapter2.Fill(dataSet11) so that you won't have any child data.  Also I'm using VS 2005.  I'm not sure that will make much of a difference but I want to make sure that you understand that so you will consider it in case you still can't duplicate it.  I say this because the sample project you sent me was VS 2003.  
     Now as far as the submitting issue I never said I haven't ever been able to submit a question to your website.  If you read the PS again you will see that I tried posting that very question friday and monday and if you look at my list of questions you will see that there was nothing posted friday by me and only one quesiton posted monday.  It wasn't until I posted the message for a third time that it actually went through.  This means had it worked every time you would of gotten the SAME EXACT QUESTION 3 times.  You only got it once.  I'm not sure what the deal is but this has happend to me before on another message.  On that message it never did go through and I gave up and I just emailed the question.  The only reason I even started using the website was in the hope that if I replied to one of your answers as I quite often do that you might be able to track better that it wasn't a new question and get to it a slight bit quicker.  I will say that if I end up losing several days because it doesn't post correctly then its sure not worth it.  I'm beggining to wonder if its the way I'm getting to the site that is making the difference.

"Hi,  
Thanks for the clarification.  
However, if I may say something: DevExpress advertises full support for VS2005, and on this prominent page [http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/whidbey.xml](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/whidbey.xml) there is a large section on how  your controls integrate so well with design time Data Sources.  
Sorry for having been excited when I read that and for trying it with XPO, DevExpress' ultimate datasource framework, but unless I'm wrong, nowhere in the documentation is it mentioned that XPO classes can't be used as data sources to quickly create UIs in that exact same way.  
So in effect you're telling me that I don't really need the fancy drag&drop data source facilities that are advertised as being so useful on DevExpress' own website.  
Don't get me wrong, I really \*do\* understand now why XPO can't work as Data Sources this way and I don't blame anyone but MS for this bug, but I would have appreciated a ""Limitations"" page in the XPO documentation or something equivalent that prominently told me that there was an issue and explained it a minimum, if only to avoid wasting time trying.  
When you dont know the full story, it's hard to make sense of why XPO objects \-that would be perfect canditates for this feature\- don't work as expected as design time Data Sources in VS2005.  
So, thanks for the friendly lesson on how I don't need this fluff \-even though I still think it's really useful when creating detail forms\- and I really wish that the next version of XPO will have that ""Limitations"" page that tells me in advance what I cannot do and shouldn't even waste time trying, with maybe a suggestion or two on how to either work around the issue or achieve the same result a different way.  
Hope you understand my point of view on this.  
Thank you very much for your time,

"Hi DevExpress  
I am writing in response to your Dev Teams update of Bug Report DB16054 in relation to XtraReports.  
I am very very disappointed with the extremely poor response to the bug and extreme length of time taken to respond to my bug report.  
I have purchased this product and I am unable to make it group data in the simplest of way as outlined in my bug report. I took the time to create a sample project  and sample database and carefully document what your tool does not do and you have not even sent me back a simple report showing what you mean in your bug resolution.  
You have marked the bug as by Design but frankly this just seems like you cannot be bothered to explain or send me a short sample of how to work around it. Nowhere in your documentation or before I purchased does it say that you cannot group a set of child records together for a Master Detail Report and NOT arrive at a correct summary total WITHOUT having to use scripting.  
I want someone to contact me urgently as per your Bug Resolution as I have tried every single way of trying to group to get correct summaries and totals and nothing works.  
I have used your PivotGrid control and it is excellent, I am sure XtraReports is too but please please take some time and send me a sample report USING MY SAMPLE DATABASE on how to arrive at the correct totals WITHOUT having to display every single child record.  
I dont want to have to wait over a week again for this repsonse and I really need this help urgently as I have an application waiting on this. If I dont hear back from you with a solution I shall have to start the money back gurantee route as I will therefore be unable to use the product.

I have been working through the support system at Component source and they too are not getting me very much information.    I purchased this component specifically for this functionallity and would greatly appreciate some support, which I have to assume is provided with this product.",2
"A further note on the behaviour of this component.  I selected all the Style properties, accepting only the default style, and it seems that blocks do appear in the scheduling area, but only at the very top, ie at time 00:00.  We have tried to follow the Help file exactly on this.  
Its been over a full day since any response was received from your support team, and that was merely to say my query had been reviewed.  Is this a normal response time?  I tried to time my query to match your time zone and you should have recieved it at the start of a working day.  To merely get an acknowledgement of receipt a full day later is not acceptable.  We are complete beginners with this product and at the risk of prejudicing the response time even further.....frankly we expect more of a support team.  Also, is there anything like a tutorial for this product, which might mean that we bother your hard pressed support team less?  The help file unfortunately is of the kind where we have to zig zag through a Microsoft Help file between properties, methods and events.

"Hi,  
I find your answer very upsetting for two reasons.  
Firstly, you have completely ignored the background information I provided which makes me question why I even bothered.  
Secondly, you seem to be under the impression that I can invest in two separate IDEs. I can't.  
My employers are not willing to lose their investment in the existing product or force their customers to retrain completey.  
Do you have any other more practical suggestions or workarounds for these issues?  
I truly do not understand the DevExpress position on this.  
While I appreciate the fact that your .NET tools were not designed to be hosted by VCL.NET forms, I suspect that a significant number of your sales are generated by word\-of\-mouth from your loyal Delphi developers.

Will your components work under Win98?",2
"First, XtraReports seems like a fine product. The Quick Starts are a good approach to fast productivity.  
I have to say that the main product documentation is a very big disappointment for several reasons.  
First and mainly, the documentation is simply too little. Very few scenarios other than totally simple are addressed. The documentation on master\-detail reports (however achieved) is skeletal. Let's face it: most of us out here have to write multi\-level hierarchical reports.  
The documentation concentrates on WYSIWYG, using your nice wizards and drag and drop. Well, reality is that many of us deal with middle tiers, factories, and other environment facts of life where we cannot simply drag a database table to a form. We have to do everything programmatically, and your documentation is totally useless in this case. I would like to strongly suggest \- as a new customer \- that you overhaul your documentation and provide useful, non\-trivial examples from scratch of getting datatables (scenarios with and without adapters), creating ad\-hoc datasets, creating data relations, and binding these in code to report and detail report labels and tables. This better documentation should also include stuff that may seem obvious to you but that I had to learn by wandering all through your current documentation, such as when to create report document, binding print engines together, and so on.  
There are also errors in the main documentation. For example, compare the documentation on how to display a report right on a WinForm with the API reference. Indeed, your documentation says to use two XtraReports objects that are not installed in the toolbox. When I finally got desperate and went to the class reference, I find that the objects you mention are shown as OBSOLETE! And that a different object is recommended. Waste of my time.  
Your web site also has some errors. For example, do a Knowledge Base search. I got six results for a search on how to do master detail reports, but the search results shows 1\-20 of 6 results. The navigation could also be improved; the hierarchical TOC on the left requires shouldn't require postbacks/shouldn't create a long history trail.  
I have spent more time with XtraReports trying to figure out basics that should absolutely be documented than is acceptable. Again, the product itself see  
ms good and whoever did the quick starts should be rewarded for creativity, but the main documentation is very frustrating. I was able to get basic reports off the ground quickly because some of the programmatic equivalents are obvious, but really... non\-trivial stuff is far too difficult to figure out with this documentation.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
Rewrite your documentation completely. Get it up to date to use current objects. Add extensive programmatic\-only examples.  
Improve web site navigation and search results.",0
"Hi again,  
Thanks for your help.  Unfortunately, we can't find any documentation on creating custom skins for XtraGrid or DevExpress.  Could you please point us to the proper documentation or provide it to us if it is not online?  
Thanks again,  
",2
But how will that help when you patently aren't replicating the real\-world conditions your control is operating in? It's all very well saying that you can't reproduce it but that isn't getting me anywhere is it? You'll appreciate Paul that I'm feeling more than a little annoyed about this because it's a very obvious problem. Just because you ca't replicate it in a little sample does not mean I'm lying to you.,0
"Thanks   
I understand the difference between focused and selected rows.  
I find your grid very difficult to programme against \- partly because the help files and samples are not task based, partly because the help files lack enough sample code to see the inter\-relation between setting different properties.  
I am sure if you become expert in the Grid it is very powerful and simple to programme. Sadly I do not have time to become expert.  
BTW I have programmed with MS grids, Infragisitc grids and ComponentOne grids with no special problems. Despite your speedy and helpful repsnses I could not recommend this grid to other developers. It takes too long to learn and it is too obscure how to complete simple tasks.

Your only reponse is to shut down a report immediately it's entered. Most bug systems keep a bug open until resolved, your bug system closes a bug as soon as you can be bothered to click a box saying you can't reproduce it \- no  investigation, no effort on your part.

"Hi,  
I have just purchased the Express Pack.  I am new to this, but it comes highly recommended.  One thing I am very interested in is not having to deal with screen resolution issues.  I understand that this is part of the LayoutControl.  What I am not sure about is if this function is part of the Express Pack that I just bought.  Must I purchase it separately?

"I am very curious on just how I am to know how to program your solution without asking you the question, waiting all weekend, waiting Monday and finally getting the answer on Tuesday.  
I searched everywhere, online docs, source code examples, and the documentation (if that is what you call it).  I even did a Google search to see if I could find this information.  
Please point me to your documentation that shows how to use XPView properties in this way so in the future I did not need to ask the question and wait for the answer.  
Also please check my account, I believe I have an active Dxperience subscription which I thought would afford me a timely response.

"Hi,  
Thank you, and I thought as much...  
To create my own customised End User Designer was my original intention, but after learning the XtraReport, XtraReport1 paradigm I got rather confused with the EUD now being a Form, so I dropped back to using yours.  But I think I'm getting there, slowly.....  
BUT, do you know of any working examples of an Custom EUD within your KB or Support Issues. An example just showing the basis of what you can do, would be so helpful!  
Sorry, to be a Cut & Paste programmer, but you have to start somehow.

Updating the translations is not a problem, but the maintenance of an additional component just sucks.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
Why don't you add your own translation component to your component\-suite? Simple import/export to TStrings and .ini or Text\-File. That's all I'm asking.

"No reasonable person can suggest that this is merely a limitation and not a bug.  It is a VERY serious flaw, which needs to be fixed.   Your suggested workaround is neither predictable nor complete, and thus is not a fix.  I honestly can't believe that DevExpress has released this as a product with knowledge of this defect.  
These cells contain DATA, which is routinely LOST on paper copies.  
Are the ramifications of this bug not crystal clear?  
This bug makes the use of ESS with EPS impossible in many industries (Health, Financial, Aviation, etc) and even outright illegal in many situations.  
Do I ""think this functionality is wrong"", as you say?  How could anyone possibly think that lost data is correct?  And why would such a serious bug require that it be re\-submitted as a mere suggestion?  When it comes to software updates, aren't bugs considered higher priorities than suggestions?  
I have submitted dozens of bugs with these products and catalogued some mind\-boggling missing features standard to all other spreadsheets, but this bug definitely takes the cake.  Calling this merely a design limitation is a serious blow to DevExpress' credibility.",0
"You asked me what I thought about the decision to not fix this so I'm responding...  
I can't say I'm happy about it even I understand your decision.  
I only know from my standpoint it causes me some problems every time I upgrade the devexpress controls and I don't really care if the tool uses native API's to achieve this purpose.  
Even if I did care about a managed solution for my final application I wouldn't be including this tool with that distribution so it wouldn't matter to me if it used native API's.",1

"Hello,  
I am a long time user of your components with an emphasis on XPO.  
I have recently started a portfolio application intended to present an idea to solve a current customers needs, and possibly to be expanded on as a product they might re\-sell.  The company is a communication infrastructure company. They obtain bulk services from top tier companies like AT&T, Sprint, CableVision and often re\-sell these directly to customers and often through third parties.  
They asked me of the possibility of writing a commission reconciliation program to help them keep track of and reconcile the 1000s of contracts. Presently they manage this process through spread sheets and it is very difficult.  They and I have looked for existing software to manage this need, and it all seems to be one sided – ie they help manage insurance (or similar) commissions. We have not found anything that ties incoming and outgoing commissions together.  
Anyhow, I saw this as good opportunity to learn WPF and possibly WF. I could then use the end product to demonstrate my companies WPF abilities and get a head start on my competition (I hope).  
I chose Microsoft small business accounting as a baseline for what I considered a desirable UI. As you know, WPF does not include a robust grid component. I know Infragistics has announced WPF components, and I assume DevExpress is also working on the same, but have not announced.  
I would be very interested in participating in a Beta of such components if possible.  This is a perfect project since it has no deadline and does not (at the moment) have an end customer paying for it.  
Thank you for consideration,  
Mike Partain

"Normally, once I've worked out the parameters of the bug I can get past it, as I have done with this one. It is nearly always much quicker for me to get past the issue myself than argue with devexpress as to whether it exists or not. They do exist, and the reason you don't see them in your bug testing, or pick them up before you release updates, is because your test sets are far too simplistic \- they do not mirror real\-world development. I work 18 hour days, 7 days a week, I don't get money for spending hours trying to diagnose faults for devexpress, I'm sorry but there it is. It is more efficient for me to try and get around the problem than exchange dozens of messages on this site. I only posted this one because it was late at night and I was sick of trying to fix yet another problem, but in the morning I got around this and it is no longer a problem for me. I appreciate that you may need more info to effect a fix (though I feel you could do a lot more to help yourselves without my help) but unless it's absolutely critical to me then I am not going to put in the time. I will post questions when i have them because you're more likely to have that info readily available and I won't have to wait, but my experience of this bug system is that it simply isn't worth participating.  
I appreciate your reply Stan, please close this report.",0
"hi  
don't you want to answer or even review????",0
"So let's talk about this.  
1) Thank you for thinking my code is broken. It uses your published events. Please tell me how, hooking OnChange, thinking that would be the place to handle Change, is ""incorrect""  
2) Thank you for a work around, but that's all it is, a work around. What exists now is broken and bugged. If that is honestly ""by design"", i.e. how you designed it, then maybe I should use something else. I'd rather not pay component vendors for them to tell me they specifically designed bugs into their components. That is honestly the only way I can interpret your response. I showed you a bug. You said thats how it's designed.  
3) Again, I appreciate the OnEditValueChanged suggestion, but it doesn't work well in my situation. I need access to the first Combo's EditValue when populating the second Combo. I do not always populate the second Combo from the change of the first, so using the Sender object from the event handler doesn't help me (unless I write some particularly ugly code). Trying to access Combo.EditValue from OnEditValueChanged will not give you the most up to date value, even if ImmediatePost is set to true. THAT is why I used OnChange to begin with. I had already tried Properties.On\*, and found that they got triggered before the value was actually changed.  
I understand there are probably 3\-4 different ways to handle populating combo's in your bars. However, to say that any one of the ways YOU provide is incorrect just boggles me. Again, I'd really like an explanation as to why handling OnChange is fundamentally \*wrong\*. Handle TdxBarCombo.OnCurChange works just fine. This is a \*bug\* no matter which way you look at it. While you're at it, Properties.OnChange is broken in exactly the same way.  
If a customer called me, and told me my Save button was AV'ing, do you think I could tell him that was ""by design"", and to use Save As instead? Are you guys going to update the Whats New to include big red bold lines saying ""DONT USE ONCHANGE OR PROPERTIES.ONCHANGE CAUSE THEY MAY NOT WORK DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO""? I just think it's leaving this open for a lot of support headache rather than fixing the problem.  
Please don't let any of this come off too harsh or offensive. But I spend a \*lot\* of my time finding bugs in these components, duplicating them, creating and recreating demo projects, filing reports on here, going back and forth with you guys, and also helping out your customers on the newsgroups. I get very frustrated when, occasionally, something like this happens. Plato, you do a wonderful job, but maybe someone else should look at this ticket with a fresh perspective. I have sent a project which uses your published properties, and doesn't work. To say ""use a different published property"" does not solve the problem, it just works around it. Maybe if this were a Q&A report that'd be ok, but this is a bug report that, imho, should stay open.  
Thanks for your time.",0
"I couldn't have picked a simpler bug to prove my point that corresponding about devexpress bugs on this forum is a waste of time, perhaps if I worked for MS I would get some reasonable response but clearly other than that the response is in nearly all cases \- shut down the report as quickly as possible and with no effort expended by devexpress. When I get a bug reported to me by my users they are kept open until they're fixed, but with devexpress any bug report is closed immediately. This particular bug is one of many to affect the xtra printing library, most of which (like this one) are not serious and would probably take 5 minutes to find and fix. That devexpress wouldn't even put that time in, and expect their own customers to diagnose every bug for them, speaks volumes for your lack of effort on behalf of your paying customers in my view \- and that is why I'm not going to waste my time doing your job when I have a job of my own.

"Hello  we do \*NOT\* write anything in those repx files manually, you are incorrect.  The only thing that has ever written to the repx file is XtraReports.  I'm very concerned about this comment you made because it might perhaps be pointing to some of the problems with your product that are preventing us from smoothly upgrading to the latest version.  
There seems to be a disconnect here between what you are telling me and what we are plainly experiencing with your products.  
We've created the reports you have and dozens of others using XtraReports only, it's been working perfectly as we have followed all the guidelines and support instructions since we first implemented your product for reporting.  Now we upgrade to the latest version and suddenly many of our most important reports are broken and you are telling me we have created the report incorrectly?  That is clearly not acceptible.  We have hundreds of customers using those reports without any issues in our application all over the world.  You are telling me they are broken and that is why they don't work with 6.2.6.?  
I don't understand what you are saying about changes and controls?  I asked where the documentation is that explains how and why the data is now being saved with the repx.  Where is that documentation and where is the documentation that explains the clearly breaking changes between 1.12.5 and 6.2.6??  
I have been very pleased with DevExpress up until this point but something is going terribly wrong over there when you are giving us these kinds of answers (and after such a long delay).  We have already tried setting the datasource to null, if you had read the issue you would see that's one of the first responses we were given.  
I need you to go back and take a closer look at this and give us a clear answer as to what needs to be done for our reports to work with XtraReports 6.2.6.  If you are unable or unwilling to look at it in detail then I request that this be escalated to someone who will.  
Telling us our reports have been manually modified and are not designed properly to work when they are in fact in use right now by hundreds of customers is not an acceptible response.  I've come to expect a lot more from DevExpress, surely you don't intend to just let these problems slide for people that were willing to buy your product when it was in it's early stages and not as popular as it is now?  
I'm not happy at all with your answer Plato, you must understand that these reports are working fine and are distributed to hundreds of users all over the world in our application.  They are not manually modified in any way, only the XtraReports user interface was used to edit them.  We upgrade to the latest version of XtraReports and suddenly things aren't working.  It is certainly not going to be acceptible to ask all our customers to modify their reports (many of them have customized already).  You're talking about a monumental problem here if I understand you correctly and I can't accept that you have published breaking  changes to your product and now tell us it's our fault that we didn't create the report properly in the first place when we FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN to create those reports in the first place.  
If this is how we are being treated for being an early adopter of your products (and let's face it they were pretty rough even a year ago) and there is no resolution you will give us then we will be forced to re\-examine our commitment to xtrareports because if you can break our reports with your updates in less than a year of updates then what does the future hold?",0
"Michael, sorry but I can't reproduce this with a simple application, I have tried! I can't send you the main application because it is too big and needs a whopping great database behind it.

"I'm sorry, but I think that is a ridiculous response.  I was told that I could use the LayoutControl in exactly the way that I have been using it.  It has been put into many base forms and now is inherited all over the application (50+ forms).  So, it is not in any way a possibility for me to go back to each of those forms and recreate the layout control as a non\-inherited control.  Your original response that this was ""By Design"" was obviously not correct since you are now saying that this is a known issue and it used to work!  You have created a bug in the newer version and it needs to be fixed.  We shouldn't have to change our software on such a broad scale just because you can't fix a bug in yours.  I'm beginning to feel very disheartened by DevExpress support in general since it seems to be a common response that things are ""By Design"" and it is rare that something which is reported is actually fixed in a timely manner.  If we supported our application like this we would be out of business quickly.",0
"Although most of our requests are answered promptly w/ in 24 to 48 hours it sometimes takes much longer when multiple communications have to go back and forth.  We always try to make sure we include a sample project for your team in order to speed things up.  For example, in one of my recent questions, Stan did a great job of answering all of my questions, but be/c of the 24\-hour turn around and the multiple questions I had for him regarding the issue, it took about a week to get a final working response w/ all of my needs met.  
The reason why this is becoming an issue for us was be/c version 6.3.1 was terribly buggy for us for the common components compared to prior major releases.  We have been working actively w/ your support team to resolve these issues.  
**Proposed Solution:**  
We currently have three premium subscriptions w/ you guys but we are willing to pay more money for faster service.  Some ideas could be an interactive chat program or a faster email response for subscribers that pay the extra fee.  The interactive chat program would allow you to share my (being the programmers) screen w/ your technician so they could guide us.  Perhaps you could have a dedicated team that handles these types of inquiries.  Having some of our questions answered w/ in a couple of hours keeps our programming team working that much more efficiently.

"Please help me with my problem with the Microsoft GridView in combination with your tab control (time is drying up now).  
It seems you do not read my bug reports from 10 November and onwards (even the subject tells I am using the standard MS GridView). The Microsoft GridView is not working because your tab control (which I converted to 6.3.1 via the projectconverter) tells it to unload on a wrong place ....

I tried to help your team of developers as good as I could to solve your bugs (even pinpointed out where it was), but I think after 2 month of trying I have to search for an other software package that has a functional tabpage (which works with the most important .NET standard controls like GridView), because my customers do not accept me to tell them for so long that the Tab control will be fixed soon.

"It doesn't look the same, it is the same. What are you doing if not producing a component used by an end\-user? I'm sorry but I don't find your argument convincing, from the very start devexpress controls haven't always had much of a grounding in the realities of actual development. I'm not having a go at you, I like bits and pieces of your controls, but your forte is not in logical thinking about control design \- many of your components carry the baggage of muddled thinking, they could do with a root and branch clear\-out of all the rubbish.  
You don't see it as a bug and/or a design flaw that neither the selected or the (irrelevent) focusrow event fires when a row in a detail view is selected by a user? Are you seriously saying that this is wholly by design and all is well with the devexpress world?",0
"No, no. I'd hate to introduce reality into your certainty that you have god\-like powers of rightness. I'd question your asserion that all your users like it, but I'd be wasting my time.

Also the article you pointed me to specifically talks about the GetInputElement() function and says ""the compressing tool has changed/miniaturized its name"".

The DevExpress Help collection for Refactor! does not appear in the Visual Studio 2003 Help contents under the conditions described in the Steps below.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
VS 2003 Pro and VS 2005 Pro both installed. Then MSDN Help for VS 2005 installed. VS 2003 is then made to share Help with VS 2005. Then VS 2003 SP1 and VS 2005 SP1 are installed. Then Refactor! is installed, specifying integrated Help.  
**Actual Results:**  
When you load unfiltered Help Contents from VS 2005, DevExpress Help collection is listed as expected.  
When you load unfiltered Help Contents from VS 2003, DevExpress Help collection is not listed.  
If you load MSDN Help separately, DevExpress Help is not listed.  
**Expected Results:**  
DevExpress Help should be listed under all conditions.  
If VS Help is installed separately for VS 2003 and VS 2005 then DevExpress Help appears in both cases. (Can't remember whether DevExpress Help appears in respective standalone MSDN Helps)

It's a really SLOW DOWN PERFOMANCE BUG!

"my suggestion is not specific to any product but is more of a general nature. i have been working with components from a few 3rd party vendors and one of them has been implementing rather successfully the concept of points. each user of the site is awarded points for reporting a bug, making a feature suggestion etc. the points awarded vary accordfing to the type of issue (e.g. bug\=100 points, new feature \= 50 points). the points can be redeemd for money when purchasing again on the online store of the vendor where each 100 points \= 1$. i really think you should implement something like this on your site. sometimes i choose not to report a bug because of all the time loss on my side explaining the problem. however i did notice that for the specific 3rd party vendor i am talking about i write about almost every bug/idea. and got to a very nice 200$ discount for my subscription renewal. these 200$ are not a loss for the vendor but rather a gain because their products are more stable and work better.

"Is it normal for Refactor to slow down a very big project to the point where VisualStudio is almost completely unusable?

"Hi  
Right we've just downloaded your sample application and run it on three development machines here in London several times. We have not been able to reproduce the problem using your sample even once \- all 18 icons appear in the taskbar every time the run.bat file is fired up. We can however still easily reproduce the problem by adding a bar manager (or a dock manager) to the project by simply dragging from the toolbox window onto the form in visual studio, just as our previous example we gave you shows. What I don't really understand is I thought you had agreed that this was a problem in the XtraBars dll somewhere and had agreed to patch it? I was somewhat surprised (bordering on amazed) to read your latest response in which you claim it is in fact nothing to do with the project (when it evidently and clearly is!)  
This is getting extremely frustrating as this is a very serious production issue for us as users are continuously calling us to say they've started the application and can't find it (or they've started it and it didn't appear). How can we take this forward from here? This sort of bug if left unresolved will force us to rethink our choice of UI component library which would be a great shame for us both I can't help but feel.

"I've discovered that when the first time that a DevExpress control is created, if the control is either BarAndDockingController or DockManager, then it is kind of slow to create.  I tested by just creating a simple C\# library and instantiating it from a C\# form.  I got startup times of .5 secs for each.  I saw another article where it was mentioned that DockManager had some initial performance issues and now it is down to about .5 sec.  I didn't see any mention of BarAndDockingController.  My question is is there any effort to speed up the initialization of these controls?  Or has a speed limit been hit?  I ask because I have a form, derived from DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraForm, that I've created, that is a combination of some DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraUserControl derived controls, and the forms start up time for the first time is rather slow and I see that about 3 sec are spent initializing the DevExpress controls (and derived controls).

"Hi   
I appreciate the quick response!  
however, I have to say that this we believe this to be basic functionality, we've purchased the library awhile ago and have ever since experienced  
several bugs (see our reported bug list) in what we consider basic functionality, this prevents us from actually using devexp in our development (not to mention the extreme time spent on detecting these bugs), it is becoming a serious issue for us here.  
We are hoping you can come up with a resolution for this specific issue or we will have to abandon this library and contact your customer service to see how to proceed.  
I do hope it is our misuse of the library and not an inherent bug in the binding functionality.  
thanx!",0
"I'm attempting to play around with the LayoutControl that you supply and  
experienced the following:  
I spent 20 minutes adding less than 20 controls to the component trying to  
get things laid out.  I have to say that not having step by step  
instructions on how to properly utilize your components is seriously making  
me question whether I want to waste time with your products.  Its come down  
between you and a couple other companies and while I like your stuff better,  
the total lack of documentation is proving to be a little more than I can  
stand.  Anyway:  
After about 20 minutes of messing around and trying to get labels to display  
properly (which I never did) the component ended up deleting itself from the  
page a number of times while trying to remove left over labels that were  
outside of the control itself.  The first time it happened I thought maybe I  
had had the control selected in combination with those I was removing but  
after the 3rd time I can honestly tell you that was not the case.  
Eventually the component deleted itself and after hitting ctrl Z to undo the  
delete, none of the fields which had previously been displayed were there  
any longer.  I ended up after numerous attempts to get things back, having  
to delete the component and start over without it.  
Is this normal behavior for this component?  Are there bugs that you're  
working out with it?  
If I purchase this stuff, is there an actual manual on how to use the  
products?  Step 1,2,3 kind of stuff?  I don't have time to dig through  
source code that you've supplied in order to figure out how to use, or  
better yet, what a component's purpose in life is.  You have a lot of  
components that don't make sense to me and that once dropped onto a form  
make even less.  No help is becoming a common scheme here.  You want a lot  
of money for your products and having no help makes me want to go back to  
Delphi...

We might want to take a breath and carefully read my communication with you.  I am not having trouble with the general features of VS.Net, nor with any of DevExpress's products at design time \-\- EXCEPT one: the xtraTabControl.

"Hi Nick,  
It would seem that I am not very good at explaining myself as most messages I send to devex are met with a question \- now I am asked for a whole project! Firstly, this message was intended to add further information to this and the other thread and to provide a bit more background on a good solution. Now I am assuming that since devex have already provided some prefetch functionality, you are already aware of the situations where it is necessary \- I assume you didn't write that functionality without a good reason \- when lazy loading is too inefficient, prefetch is the answer. If the context requires data from more than one hierarchy branch then being able to prefetch more than one branch at once is clearly the best solution. I'm not really sure what else there is to say about it! As pointed out in the other thread, reports are a good example of a situation where prefetch can be a very effective optimisation \- e.g a customer order report showing customers, their contacts and their orders and possibly order details.

"I am starting a rather big application mid may 2007. DevExpress will be used for a lot of controls.  
The only issue lacking to use XtraBars is the missing Tabgrouping capabilities of MDI Windows.

"Hi   
I'm not really clear why you are still suggesting that this is not a worthwhile feature to implement, particularly as it is so simple to do,  but I guess it's your call. I am surprised that you are asking why it is not a good idea to add a reference to a factory to my constructors. The whole concept of the builder pattern and DI/IOC is to separate the dependent class from any knowledge of what implements the dependency or how it obtains the reference to the implementer. By directly implementing the factory in the constructor you are breaking the principle of separation of concerns.

"Hi  Thanks for the response.  
Yes I understand what you mean and I already did something similar. The thing I wanted to state was that IMHO it is a bad idea to register a custom PNG handler in a \*GUI\* component set.  
It is not expected and I find it hard to see the need for it (although I guess there is one otherwise you guys would not have done it). Another point is that this modification causes exceptions in applications that use other third party component sets (gnostice in my case). But if you guys still think it is good idea feel free to close this issue.  
One last question I like to see answered: What happens if I register my own PNG handler? Will it break functionality in the DevExpress components?",2
"Currently not all dev express controls and components are supporting BMP32 and PNG images in their Glyph property. Some controls are only supporting BMP24, some are providing support for BMP24 & BMP32 and others are supporting BMP24, BMP32 and PNG with alpha channel. It's hard to create a modern looking gui with these limitations.  
BMP24 example: TcxButton (there is a workaround posted in issue CS41515), but I do not want to modify the dev express sources. Because every update will suck than. :(  
BMP24 & BMP32 example: TdxBarLargeButton.GlyphHot does not support PNG images, but the property TdxBarLargeButton.Glyph does. TdxBar.Glyph is another example.  
BMP24, BMP32 & PNG example: The application button of the ribbon. This seems to be recently added (issue CB47400).  
There are more examples, but I don't want to create a full list. I think you can find them ourself by just searching the word ""Glyph"" in the sources. :)

"Sometimes I think of a really useful feature for a DX product which I believe to be ""low hanging fruit"" (really easy to implement)  usually it is because it's almost identical to an existing feature.

I applaud this strategy. I would however like the ability to be able to indicate my beleif that a given suggestion is LHF so that perhaps extra consideration be given to implementing it sooner rather than later.  
Such an option could be a tick box like the 'priority' or 'private' options.  
It could be argued that this is very like the priority option, but I would suggest that most LHF are not truely urgent but may provide a good RIA with regard to developer time.  
I would also argue that some developers like to work on items when a very little work (hence potentially very little testing) is required.

"Yes, I understand this is ""by design"".  But that's the problem.  I have seen several other posts about this, and rather than closing this issue and marking is as ""by design"", I think you need to reconsider the design and add this to the plans for a future version.  As developers, we have to deal with many other components, including custom components, and many of these are based upon the TGraphicControl.  By implementing a design that requires a window handle, you are excluding your popup menu system from being used with these other controls.

"Thanks  We purchased the XtraNavBar package and everything seems to be working now.  
I just have to say for the record that this doesn't seem like an ideal solution to me. If you're selling source code licenses, there's an implicit assumption that the source code package will be complete and buildable as shipped. I understand how integrated the XtraNavBar is in your designers, so if it can't be removed it should be shipped with every package that depends on it. XtraNavBar by itself is inexpensive, so even if you increased the price of the packages that include it your pricing would still be very competitive. It wouldn't make much difference to your bottom line, but it would mean so much for customer satisfaction if everything ""just worked"" right out of the box. It would save you some support time too, since you wouldn't have to keep answering this question on the forums, nor would you have to spend engineering time rebuilding your customers' DLLs for them.  
The point is moot now for us since we've already bought the additional XtraNavBar licenses, but I hope you'll consider doing something like this in the future.

"I have been tracking this issue:  
[http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AS16121.aspx](http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/AS16121.aspx)  
First, there is no associated explanation, nor is there any timeframe established. So, I think “some day” DevExpress might actually implement the suggestion.  
Here is my problem: Let’s say I have this interface:  
    public interface IOrder {  
        string Name { get;set;}  
        Customer Customer { get;set;}  
        XpCollection\<LineItem\> LineItems { get;}  
        DateTime OrderDate { get;set;}  
    }  
 This works great for XPO, but is terrible for compliance with object\-oriented, or test\-driven development. I have non\-XPO objects/classes that need to implement various interfaces (many already do) and the object property, Customer, as well as the collection, XpCollection\<LineItem\> are actual object references and are NOT interface references.  
XPO “should” be compatible with this interface:  
    public interface IOrder {  
        string Name { get;set;}  
        ICustomer Customer { get;set;}  
        IList\<ILineItem\> LineItems { get;}  
        DateTime OrderDate { get;set;}  
    }  
 In my opinion, XPO is pseudo object\-oriented or pseudo compatible with generics because of this limitation. There is a simple rule involved:  
      “Program or interact with interfaces, not implementations: its called decoupling!!”  
So, I ask, is there any serious effort underway to support proper OO design and have XPO support interfaces – especially the “commonly” implemented interfaces like IList\<T\>?  
What do you suggest I do in the mean time? An Order is not an Order without a Customer assigned, or without a list/collection of Line Items.  
 I have no problem if the actual ILineItem passed into XPO also has to implement additional interfaces such as a hypothetical IMapTo interface to define the associated or underlying database table in the relationship (just a quick thought). I want to emphasize that I think I should be able to pass an XPO object into another object that doesn’t care about the persistece features.  
Frankly, I am a little concerned about XPO. Prior to XAF, it was getting serious attention. After introducing XAF, the support and development has noticably declined. It “appears” (from the outside) that the developers who “were” working on XPO were reassigned to XAF. For example, I have not seen a DevExpress employee contribute significantly on the forum for XPO for some time.  
I mention this because the issue has become substantial. I cannot serialize significant XPO objects (like the XPView), I cannot use standard interfaces, and in the last year only bugs have been fixed with very little new features introduced. I am required to deploy an N\-Tier application and I am finding that the limitations are smacking me at every turn: I can’t use XPO objects outside of the business logic tier because of serialization, so I had to devlop and maintan “DTO” or data transfer objects. Now am finding that I can’t even use the same interfaces, I have to create converters from regular OO objects to XPO objects. All this work is making it seem simpler to just go back to writing the SQL. Also, these conversions are a performance problem when you add up all the transactions: Every single collections must be loaded, then every item (record) must be cycled to copy it into a serializable version of the object. The same happens when sending objects back from the client to XPO. Maybe you think this is reasoable, but it adds up when it must be done for every save, every request, every report.  
So, I am sorry for the long letter, but I am getting worried: many users have asked me privately if I know what is going on. There is a growing consensus that XPO has limited support \- simply limited to bug fixes alone. I need to know if DevExpress is going to put some real effort back into XPO, are there any upgrades in the works?  
I cannot see a bigger or more important issue that compatibilty with interfaces. I can live with the serialization even though I think thi should be fixed as well, but the forced coupling to XPO instances is becoming problematic.  
Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? I think you know that I have been a long\-time supporter and very active user of DevExpress products – with special emphasis on XPO. I am also tired and a little frustrated.

This is not a problem with devExpress controls.,2
"Thansk for the timely answer, Serge. No, I don't have newer IDEs installed so the manual rebuild isn't an option. I've always tried to keep all libraries updated to minimize the chance of running into bugs, so can you please confirm that the only way left for me is to go through the what's new list for every maintenance release and ask for the bug fixes made available for the products I own? Also, I had already scheduled the purchase of two more libraries, ExpressPivot Grid and Express Scheduler, and I would like to know if I will be able to use the last working installer to install them \- this if I decide to stick to this plan, since it's very, very frustrating to update some and purchase other products that offered support to the IDE in use just to find one month later, and after a lot of work to take advantage of new features, that Developer Express decided not to support it any longer.  
Thanks,  
Carlos",0
"Thanks for the response \- this works fine and it's great to see this kind of real value coming from the control.  
This issue betrays in me a lack of knowledge and experience with how bound controls work.  It did not occur to me that things would be quite this simple, but it makes perfect sense seeing it now.  Almost too good to be true.  I still don't have a good feel for exactly how things work under the hood, but I can live with that as long as things keep working!  
For someone like me, it would help to have some words somewhere early in the documentation/overviews that simply describe that this is the way things work.  After combing the documentation for hours, I'm pretty sure that there's little or no direct explanation.  And with something that doesn't require code there isn't much code to help one find his/her way.  As intuitive as it seems now, I am the type to look either for examples or documentation that show the way, and was stuck not being able to find that .

To confirm this is something that DevExpress does not supply natively?   Are you going to add it?   You have end user options for almost everything else and it seems that this is not the first time someone has asked for this obvious capability.",2
"Sorry, but I cannot understand. A lot of people (your customer) need an update for a new version due to using a new version of IDE. I have used your components and now I have to check out other components from other provider which can I integrate with a lot of work.

"We've been building an application using the beta builds of the Skins library in BDS 2006 and today as I try to upgrade to r.28 of the installer it says ES is not supported under CB10! So now I either have to rip it out of my application and find a replacement product or continue working with the beta release.

"Dear Stan  
I think we both know this is nonsense. There is absolutely no reason why your components shouldn't display sensible tooltips. ""Specifies Support for Transacted Initialization"" is quite meaningless. It is obviously unacceptable to refer developers to documentation when the information they require should be right there in front of them. The learning curve with your products is ferocious and all I'm asking for is a little help from the GUI. Why this is not possible is totally beyond me. I assure you that in most organizations such behavior would not pass QA.  
By ""I also should say that you can easily obtain an information about our control in our documentation."" Are you referring to your on\-line web based documentation?  
Also is it possible to sort the toolbar items into alphabetical order?

"Hello,  
of course I could create my own descendants (I am not a beginner...). But my past experience also with other 3rd party components showed that this is not pleasant, when I install an update of the underlying 3rd party components. So much problems with recompiling own libs, installing/deinstalling... D2007 seems to have not improved in this respect. So, to avoid this for my new versions, I looked for a lib which seemed to be almost complete, and found DX...  
As to the Bar components, there is another problem which prevents me from deriving own components. I found that there will be problems with the bar manager when placing controls onto a bar just in the ordinary way. Using the context menu seems to be the only reasonable method. But my derived components will not appear there.

I notice also the point labels are rounding, how can that be stopped? Accuracy is important in the legal framework and juries can interpret rounding as dishonesty during presentations.  
Speaking of dishonesty, don't you feel it is dishonest to accept customer change requests when you don't intend to implement them unless they meet some internally defined measure of popularity? In my view, it is acting in bad faith to accept a customer change request and not implement it within a reasonable time period \- say 6 months maximum. If you have no intention of implementing something you should be honest and say so, perhaps put the request into a ""Pending for review"" category or something. You should not accept a customer change request unless you intend to do something about it, there is little point keeping people hanging on for their change(s) to be implemented when they could solve their problem by using a control from someone else that does implement it. It helps them because they get their job done more efficiently, it helps you because you aren't constantly letting people down and explaining why you haven't done something you said you were going to do.",0

" when I post here I have an expectation that the support people will actually take the time to read what I have written.

What do you do?  You link me back to it.  How does that make \*any\* sense in your mind?  
If you are not interested in giving helpful answers please have someone else respond because this is starting to get ridiculous.   I've asked for almost two years now for something that is industry standard.  Infragistics publishes a complete change list, Telerik publishes a complete change list, everyone publishes a complete change list except you guys.  You still don't after it was promised that you would in this very Issue!  And critical breaking changes are left out of the blog post which is a ridiculous place to put breaking changes, when they should be in the knowledgebase itself AND in the documentation and help files.  
Here is just one breaking change that is \*NOT\* on that page:  
[http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q91400.aspx](http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/Q91400.aspx)  
I expect to have available upon a new release a complete list of \*everything\* that was changed that a developer could be affected by and special attention given to any breaking changes by grouping them together in the document or highlighting them in some way.  Right now a DevExpress update is a crapshoot, we never know what is going to break but something always does and to date I have never had a major update from DevExpress that didn't break my code and I have yet to have any of the breaking changes turn out to be documented anywhere in any change list and it's been going on for years now.  
If you guys don't see that as a problem then there's nothing more I can do I guess, but this is the last time I'm taking the time on this issue.  I'll resort to what other developers have to do which is hound you guys with support issues instead after things break and never do a DevExpress update anywhere near release time.

"I have invested considerable effort in building a product around ExpressSpreadsheet, and was greatly chagrined to learn later (despite what was implied by the Frozen Pane demo) that ExpressSpreadsheet really has no frozen pane support whatsoever. I'm sure you folks are aware that the lack of frozen pane support is a major limitation in an otherwise very complete and excellent product\-\-there have been a number of comments/feature requests about it here, and elsewhere.  
I have decided our product cannot live with frozen pane support. It is a commercial product for end users...and the lack of frozen panes will make output to the ExpressSpredsheet very difficult for most people to use. Hence, many potential users will not buy our product simply because the UI appears lame/deficient.  
Therefore, sometime in the next 60 days I \*will\* make an effort to support frozen panes with ExpressSpreadsheet...possibly by rewriting the painting system (looks messy), or by multiple paint cycles to paint separate juxtaposed parts of the viewable region, coupled with modified mouse support, etc., etc.  
My question is this:  Would there be any possible way, under any special arrangement/non\-disclosure agreement/otherwise to get an internal copy of the \*commented\* source code for the ExpressSpreadsheet?  
It seems senseless for me to spend days trying to figure out parts of the code, for which some kind of internal documentation surely must exist. And if I am able to add reasonably efficient frozen pane support, it might be a way for you folks to extend the life of a product which, it seems to me, is clearly only ""on life support"" at Developer's Express (that is, never likely to see a major upgrade, ever again).  
Thoughts? Possibilities? I'd be interested what someone there in management might have to say...

" Sorry, but this simply doesn't make sense. The installer did NOT offer a choice of root install directory, and it did not install into C:\Program Files\Developers Express.VCL, and I \*will\* have to mess with this in order to fix it.  
This is probably better followed up in issue Q92633, but here's my current guess at the problem:  
Previously (years ago) I installed dev express components in:  
C:\Borland\Delphi6\\_LibDevExp\  
The latest DevExpress iinstaller is now treating that as the root install directory.  
Now, as time has gone by, it seems that when multiple versions of Delphi are supported, Dev Express really should install in one common directory for all versions, which obviously is silly to place below a specific version of Delphi.  
OK, fine, probably what I have to do is UNinstall Dev Express completely, and install totally from scratch, and set the dev exp root to something sensible (and then fix up whatever paths are still pointing to the old location).  
But why is it a problem for you guys to just tell us this out \*before\* my installation gets all screwed up? The line ""we don't tell you because we don't want you to mess with it \-\- is simply incompatible with the fact that your installer is making assumptions that don't necessarily hold.

"Why my question is not clear?  
Do not you know what is your competition doing?  
In your descriptions you have stated that your controls have unmatched flexibility, which is not the truth.  
As I pointed out Infragistics in their NetAdvantage collection or Innovasys in their DockStudio control made excellent panel docking and document windows functionality.  
Your XtraTabbedMdiManager1 component is very limited in comparison to those described above.  
So, the question is really simple:  
Are you having any plans to implement better functionality of your docking panels/windows components?  
If not then I will not waste my time with your XtraTabbedMdiManager1 and DockManager1.",0
"Sorry for the delay, I've been out for some Christmas vacation time.  
I understand your response, in light of what I know support engineers usually cannot say concerning product updates and future features. But at the same time I hope you will understand how I see your answer as a ""non\-answer"" to my questions. Your answer appeared to be of the ""brush off"" or ""put off"" variety.  
You did not address my questions really; in fact, you even suggested I try the very Frozen Pane demo (A1050) which I stated does \*not\* work. The only way the Frozen Pane implementation in A1050 works is if all columns and rows are displayed at the \*default\* column width/row height! (I have investigated the code in considerable detail, and its limitations appear insurmountable without taking an entirely different approach.)  
Also, I expect direct, honest answers. Maybe yours are but they don't appear so to me. Your use of the phrases ""...planning to introduce this product feature in a future version..."" and ""Meantime, I suggest..."" imply an update schedule or at least a planned update path, which does \*not\* square with other information I've seen concerning ExpressSpreadsheet. For example, as as recently as November 2007  said in Q50666:  
""...I cannot give you a definite answer regarding the future of the ExpressSpreadSheet. It is now frozen. We don't develop new features in it, but only fix issues reported by our customers. We do have a list of features to introduce into future versions of the control. However, we haven't yet decided whether to do this or not....  
Thanks,  

So which is the truth? A likely upgrade to the product, or a ""black hole"" of promised feature requests that never will happen?  
I have been discreet in asking my questions:  I marked this issue as Private so we might be able to hold a forthright discussion without injuring product marketability for ExpressSpreadsheet. Therefore, I continue to hope for more direct answers.  
(Even ""No"" is a better answer than a fluff\-laden deflection from the specifics of my questions.)  
I believe I understand your perspective, but as an ExpressSpreadsheet customer I hope you can understand mine. No ill will here, just frustration with having my time wasted.

"Thanks for the reply.  
\> All the source files included in the installation are taken ""as is"" from our source code storage. Yes, our developers don't include comments in our source files.  
Ok, I can believe that.  
But I cannot believe that additional technical documentation of ExpressSpreadsheet doesn't exist.  
When source code comments are not the primary means of documenting a project\-\-as I realize is the practice in some shops\-\-there \*must\* at least be external notes concerning the design and organization of various chunks of the project. Else, if a key person...""the one guy who understands this pile of code""...were to quit or die, both maintenance and new development can be stalled for many weeks.  
Failure to maintain some form of documentation beyond raw, uncommented source code would be worse than unprofessional, edging into ""silly"" or ""foolhardy"". And I consider DevExpress products to be among the most professionally designed, maintained, and supported products around...which is way I won't believe there is no additional documentation of the innards of ExpressSpreadsheet.  
To sum up:  If any kind of documentation is available and you could release it to those of us trying to use ExpressSpreadsheet for serious work, it might help some of us overcome the product's major deficiencies (such as lack of frozen pane support)...extending the life of the product for DevX.  I'm not talking about open source software here, but merely open, forthright, healthy support of the user community for this product.",1
